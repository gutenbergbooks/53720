<h2>INTRODUCTORY PREFACE TO THE
TRANSLATION</h2>


<p>Stendhal's three prefaces to this work on Love
are not an encouraging opening. Their main theme
is the utter incomprehensibility of the book to all but
a very select few&mdash;"a hundred readers only": they are
rather warnings than introductions. Certainly, the early
life of Stendhal's <i>De l'Amour</i> justifies this somewhat
distant attitude towards the public. The first and
second editions were phenomenal failures&mdash;not even
a hundred readers were forthcoming. But Stendhal,
writing in the early part of the nineteenth century,
himself prophesied that the twentieth would find his
ideas at least more comprehensible. The ideas of genius
in one age are the normal spiritual food for superior
intellect in the next. Stendhal is still something of a
mystery to the general public; but the ideas, which he
agitated, are at present regarded as some of the most
important subjects for immediate enquiry by many of
the keenest and most practical minds of Europe.</p>

<p>A glance at the headings of the chapters gives an idea
of the breadth of Stendhal's treatment of love. He
touches on every side of the social relationship between
man and woman; and while considering the disposition
of individual nations towards love, gives us a brilliant,
if one-sided, general criticism of these nations, conscious
throughout of the intimate connexion in any given age
between its conceptions of love and the status of woman.</p>

<p>Stendhal's ideal of love has various names: it is
generally "passion-love," but more particularly "love
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span><i>à l'italienne.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The thing in itself is always the same&mdash;it
is the love of a man and a woman, not as husband
and wife, not as mistress and lover, but as two human
beings, who find the highest possible pleasure, not in
passing so many hours of the day or night together, but
in living one life. Still more, it is the attachment of
two free fellow-creatures&mdash;not of master and slave.</p>

<p>Stendhal was born in 1783&mdash;eight years before Olympe
de Gouges, the French Mary Wollstonecraft, published
her <i>Déclaration des Droits des Femmes</i>. That is to say,
by the time Stendhal had reached mental maturity,
Europe had for some time been acquainted with the cry
for Women's Rights, and heard the earliest statement
of the demands, which have broadened out into what
our age glibly calls the "Woman Question." How,
may we ask, does Stendhal's standpoint correspond
with his chronological position between the French
Revolution and the "Votes for Women" campaign of
the present day?</p>

<p>Stendhal is emphatically a champion of Women's
Rights. It is true that the freedom, which Stendhal
demands, is designed for other ends than are associated
to-day with women's claims. Perhaps Stendhal, were
he alive now, would cry out against what he would
call a distortion of the movement he championed. Men,
and still more women, must be free, Stendhal holds, in
order to love; his chapters in this book on the education
of women are all an earnest and brilliant plea to prove
that an educated woman is not necessarily a pedant; that
she is, on the contrary, far more <i>lovable</i> than the
uneducated woman, whom our grandfathers brought up
on the piano, needlework and the Catechism; in fine, that
intellectual sympathy is the true basis of happiness in
the relations of the two sexes. Modern exponents of
Women's Rights will say that this is true, but only half
the truth. It would be more correct to say that Stendhal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>saw the whole truth, but forbore to follow it out to
its logical conclusion with the blind <i>intransigeance</i> of
the modern propagandist. Be that as it may, Stendhal
certainly deserves more acknowledgment, as one of the
pioneers in the movement, than he generally receives
from its present-day supporters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stendhal was continually lamenting his want of ability
to write. According to him, a perusal of the <i>Code
Civil</i>, before composition, was the best way he had
found of grooming his style. This may well have something
to do with the opinion, handed on from one history
of French literature to another, that Stendhal, like
Balzac&mdash;it is usually put in these very words&mdash;<i>had no
style</i>. It is not, correctly speaking, what the critics
themselves mean: to have no style would be to chop
and change from one method of expression to another,
and nothing could be less truly said of either of these
writers. They mean that he had a bad style, and that
is certainly a matter of taste. Perhaps the critics, while
condemning, condemn themselves. It is the severe
beauty of the <i>Code Civil</i> which, makes them uncomfortable.
An eye for an eye and a spade for a spade is
Stendhal's way. He is suspicious of the slightest adornment:
everything that is thought clearly can be written
simply. Other writers have had as simplified a style&mdash;Montesquieu
or Voltaire, for example&mdash;but there is
scant merit in telling simply a simple lie, and Voltaire,
as Stendhal himself says, was afraid of things which are
difficult to put into words. This kind of daintiness is
not Stendhal's simplicity: he is merely uncompromising
and blunt. True, his bluntness is excessive. A nice
balance between the severity of the <i>Code Civil</i> and
the "drums and tramplings" of Elizabethan English
comes as naturally to an indifferent pen, whipped into
a state of false enthusiasm, as it is foreign to the warmth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>of genuine conviction. Had Stendhal been a little less
vehement and a little less hard-headed, there might
have been fewer modifications, a few less repetitions,
contradictions, ellipses&mdash;but then so much the less
Stendhal. In that case he might have trusted himself:
as it was he knew his own tendency too well and took
fright. Sometimes in reading Carlyle, one wishes that
he had felt the same kind of modesty: he, certainly,
could never have kept to the thin centre line, and we
should have had another great writer "without a style."
Effect meant little to Stendhal, hard fact and clearness
everything. Perhaps, he would often have made his
meaning clearer, if he had been less suspicious of
studied effect and elaborate writing. Not infrequently
he succeeds in being colloquial and matter-of-fact, without
being definite.</p>

<p>Stendhal was beset with a horror of being artistic.
Was it not he who said of an artist, whose dress was
particularly elaborate: "Depend upon it, a man who
adorns his person will also adorn his work"? Stendhal
was a soldier first, then a writer&mdash;Salviati<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is a soldier.
Certainly it is his contempt for the type of person&mdash;even
commoner, perhaps, in 1914 than in 1814&mdash;who carries
his emotions on his sleeve, which accounts for Stendhal's
naive disclaimer of personal responsibility, the invention
of Lisio<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and Salviati, mythical authors of this work on
love&mdash;all a thin screen to hide his own obsession, which
manages, none the less, to break through unmasked on
almost every page.</p>

<p>The translation makes no attempt to hide these
peculiarities or even to make too definite a sense from a
necessarily doubtful passage.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Its whole aim is to reproduce
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>Stendhal's essay in English, just as it stands in
French. No other English translation of the whole work
exists: only a selection of its maxims translated piece-meal.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Had a translation existed, we should certainly
not have undertaken another. As it is, we have relied
upon a great sympathy with the author, and a studied
adhesion to what he said, in order to reconstruct this
essay&mdash;encouraged by the conviction that the one is as
necessary as the other in order to obtain a satisfactory
result. Charles Cotton's <i>Montaigne</i> seems to us the
pattern of all good translations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In spite of the four prefaces of the original, we felt it
advisable to add still another to the English translation.
Stendhal said that no book stood in greater need of a
word of introduction. That was in Paris&mdash;here it is a
foreigner, dressed up, we trust, quite <i>à l'anglaise</i>, but
still, perhaps, a little awkward, and certainly in need of
something more than the chilly announcement of the title
page&mdash;about as encouraging as the voice of the flunkey,
who bawls out your name at a party over the heads of
the crowd already assembled. True, the old English
treatment of foreigners has sadly degenerated: more bows
than brickbats are their portion, now London knows the
charm of <i>cabarets, revues</i> and cheap French cooking.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>The work in itself is conspicuous, if not unique. Books
on Love are legion: how could it be otherwise? It was
probably the first topic of conversation, and none has
since been found more interesting. But Stendhal
has devised a new treatment of the subject. His
method is analytical and scientific, but, at the same time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>there is no attempt at bringing the subject into line
with a science; it is no part of erotology&mdash;there is no</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Greek ending with a little passing bell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That signifies some faith about to die.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His faith is unimpeachable and his curiosity and honesty
unbounded: this is what makes him conspicuous. In
claiming to be scientific, Stendhal meant nothing more
than that his essay was based purely upon unbiassed
observation; that he accepted nothing upon vague
hearsay or from tradition; that even the finer shades of
sentiment could be observed with as much disinterested
precision, if not made to yield as definite results, as any
other natural phenomena. "The man who has known
love finds all else unsatisfying"&mdash;is, properly speaking, a
scientific fact.</p>

<p>Analytical, however, is the best word to characterise
the Stendhalian method. Scientific suggests, perhaps,
more naturally the broader treatment of love, which is
familiar in Greek literature, lives all through the Middle
Ages, is typified in Dante, and survives later in a host of
Renaissance dialogues and treatises on Love. This love&mdash;see
it in the <i>Symposium</i> of Plato, in Dante or in the
<i>Dialoghi</i> of Leone Ebreo&mdash;is more than a human passion,
it is also the <i>amor che muove il sole e le altre stelle</i>,
the force of attraction which, combined with hate,
the force of repulsion, is the cause of universal movement.
In this way love is not only scientifically treated,
it embraces all other sciences within it. Scientists will
smile, but the day of Science and Art with a contemptuous
smile for each other is over. True, the
feeling underlying this cosmic treatment of love is
very human, very simple&mdash;a conviction that love, as a
human passion, is all-important, and a desire to justify
its importance by finding it a place in a larger order of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>things, in the "mystical mathematics of the kingdom
of Heaven." Weaker heads than Plato are also pleased
to call love divine, without knowing very clearly what
they mean by divinity. Their ignorance is relative;
the allegorical representation of Eros&mdash;damned and
deified alternately by the poets&mdash;is in motive, perhaps,
not so far from what we have called the scientific, but,
perhaps, might better have named the cosmic, treatment.</p>

<p>In a rough classification of books on Love one can
imagine a large number collected under the heading&mdash;"Academic."
One looks for something to express that
want of plain dealing, of <i>terre-à-terre</i> frankness, which is
so deplorable in the literature of Love, and is yet the
distinctive mark of so much of it. "Academic" comprehends
a wide range of works all based on a more or
less set or conventional theory of the passions. It
includes the average modern novel, in which convention
is supreme and experience negligible&mdash;just a traditional,
lifeless affair, in which there is not even a pretence of
curiosity or love of truth. And, at the same time, "academic"
is the label for the kind of book in which convention
is rather on the surface, rather in the form than in
the matter. Tullia of Aragon, for example, was no tyro in
the theory and practice of love, but her <i>Dialogo d'Amore</i>
is still distinctly academic. Of course it is easy to be
misled by a stiff varnish of old-fashioned phrase; the
reader in search of sincerity will look for it in the thought
expressed, not in the manner of expression. There is
more to be learnt about love from Werther, with all
his wordy sorrows, than from the slick tongue of Yorick,
who found it a singular blessing of his life "to be almost
every hour of it miserably in love with someone." But,
then, just because Werther is wordy, all his feelings
come out, expressed one way or another. With
Tullia, and others like her, one feels that so much
is suppressed, because it did not fit the conventional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>frame. What she says she felt, but she must have
felt so much more or have known that others felt
more.</p>

<p>This suppression of truth has, of course, nothing to do
with the partial treatment of love necessary often in
purely imaginative literature. No one goes to poetry
for an anatomy of love. Not love, but people in love,
are the business of a playwright or a novelist. The
difference is very great. The purely imaginative writer
is dealing with situations first, and then with the passions
that cause them.</p>

<p>Here it is interesting to observe that Stendhal, in
gathering his evidence, makes use of works of imagination
as often as works based upon fact or his own
actual experience.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Characters from Scott are called in
as witnesses, side by side with Mademoiselle de Lespinasse
or Mariana Alcaforado.</p>

<p>The books mentioned by Stendhal are of two distinct
kinds. There are those, from which he draws evidence
and support for his own theories, and in which the connexion
with love is only incidental (Shakespeare's Plays,
for example, <i>Don Juan</i> or the <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i>), and
others whose authors are really his forerunners, such as
André le Chapelain.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Stendhal gives some account of
this curious writer, who perhaps comes nearer his own
analytical method than any later writer. In fact, we
have called Stendhal unique perhaps too rashly&mdash;there
are others he does not mention, who, in a less sustained
and intentional way, have attempted an analytical, and
still imaginative, study of love. Stendhal makes no
mention of a short essay on Love by Pascal, which certainly
falls in the same category as his own. It is less
illuminating than one might expect, but to read it is to
appreciate still more the restraint, which Stendhal has
consciously forced upon himself. Others also since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>Stendhal&mdash;Baudelaire, for instance&mdash;have made casual
and valuable investigations in the Stendhalian method.
Baudelaire has here and there a maxim which, in brilliance
and exactitude, equals almost anything in this
volume.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>And then&mdash;though this is no place for a bibliography
of love&mdash;there is Hazlitt's <i>Liber Amoris</i>. Stendhal would
have loved that patient, impartial chronicle of love's
ravages: instead of Parisian <i>salons</i> and Duchesses it is
all servant-girls and Bloomsbury lodging-houses; but the
<i>Liber Amoris</i> is no less pitiful and, if possible, more real
than the diary of Salviati.</p>

<p>There are certain books which, for the frequency of
their mention in this work, demand especial attention of
the reader&mdash;they are its commentary and furnish much
of the material for its ideas.</p>

<p>In number CLXV of "Scattered Fragments" (below,
p. <a href="#Page_328">328</a>) Stendhal gives the list as follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>The <i>Autobiography</i> of Benvenuto Cellini.</li>
<li>The novels of Cervantes and Scarron.</li>
<li><i>Manon Lescaut</i> and <i>Le Doyen de Killerine</i>, by the Abbé Prévôt.</li>
<li>The Latin Letters of Héloïse to Abelard.</li>
<li><i>Tom Jones.</i></li>
<li><i>Letters of a Portuguese Nun.</i></li>
<li>Two or three stories by Auguste La Fontaine.</li>
<li>Pignotti's <i>History of Tuscany</i>.</li>
<li>Werther.</li>
<li>Brantôme.</li>
<li><i>Memoirs</i> of Carlo Gozzi (Venice, 1760)&mdash;only the eighty pages on
the history of his love affairs.</li>
<li>The <i>Memoirs</i> of Lauzun, Saint-Simon, d'Épinay, de Staël, Marmontel,
Bezenval, Roland, Duclos, Horace Walpole, Evelyn, Hutchinson.</li>
<li>Letters of Mademoiselle Lespinasse.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>All these are more or less famous works, with which,
at least by name, the general reader is familiar. Brantôme's
witty and entertaining writings, the <i>Letters of a
Portuguese Nun</i> and those of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse,
perhaps the sublimest letters that have ever been
written, are far less read than they deserve. The rest&mdash;excepting
perhaps Scarron, Carlo Gozzi, Auguste La
Fontaine, and one or two of the less-known Memoirs&mdash;are
the common reading of a very large public.</p>

<p>This list of books is mentioned as the select library of
Lisio Visconti, who "was anything but a great reader."
Lisio Visconti is one of the many imaginary figures,
behind which hides Stendhal himself; we have already
suggested one reason for this curious trait. Besides Lisio
Visconti and Salviati, we meet Del Rosso, Scotti, Delfante,
Pignatelli, Zilietti, Baron de Bottmer, etc. etc. Often
these phantom people are mentioned side by side with a
character from a book or a play or with someone Stendhal
had actually met in life. General Teulié<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> is a real person&mdash;Stendhal's
superior officer on his first expedition in
Italy: Schiassetti is a fiction. In the same way the dates,
which the reader will often find appended to a story or a
note, sometimes give the date of a real event in Stendhal's
life, while at other times it can be proved that, at the
particular time given, the event mentioned could not
have taken place. This falsification of names and dates
was a mania with Stendhal. To most of his friends he
gave a name completely different from their real one,
and adopted with each of them a special pseudonym for
himself. The list of Stendhal's pseudonyms is extensive
and amusing.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But he was not always thorough in his
system of disguise: he is even known to have written
from Italy a letter in cypher, enclosing at the same time
the key to the cypher!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>We have only to make a few additions to Lisio Visconti's
list of books already mentioned, in order to have a
pretty fair account of the main sources of reference and
suggestion, to which Stendhal turned in writing his
<i>De l'Amour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> There are Rousseau's <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i> and
<i>Émile</i>. Stendhal holds that, except for very green youth,
the <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i> is unreadable. Yet in spite of its
affectation, it remained for him one of the most important
works for the study of genuine passion. Then we must
add the <i>Liaisons Dangereuses</i>&mdash;a work which bears certain
resemblances to Stendhal's <i>De l'Amour</i>. Both are the
work of a soldier and both have a soldierly directness;
for perfect balance and strength of construction few
books have come near the <i>Liaisons Dangereuses</i>&mdash;none
have ever surpassed it. There is the <i>Princesse de Clèves</i>
of Madame de Lafayette and <i>Corinne</i> by Madame de
Staël, whose typically German and extravagant admiration
for Italy touched a weak spot in Stendhal. After
Chateaubriand's <i>Génie du Christianisme</i>, which Stendhal
also refers to more than once, the works of Madame de
Staël were, perhaps, the greatest working influence in the
rise of Romanticism. What wonder, then, that Stendhal
was interested? To the letters of Mlle. de Lespinasse
and of the Portuguese Nun we must add the letters of
Mirabeau, written during his imprisonment at Vincennes,
to Sophie de Monnier. Further, we must add the writings
of certain moral teachers whose names occur frequently
in the following pages: Helvétius, whom
Clarétie<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> amusingly calls the <i>enfant terrible</i> of the philosophers;
de Tracy<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>; Volney, author of the once celebrated
<i>Ruines</i>, traveller and philosopher. These names
are only the most important. Stendhal's reading was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>extensive, and we might swell the list with the names
of Montesquieu, Condillac, Condorcet, Chamfort,
Diderot&mdash;to name only the moralists.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that almost all these books, mentioned
as the favourite authorities of Stendhal, are eighteenth-century
works. The fact will seem suspicious to those
inclined to believe that the eighteenth century was a time
of pretty ways and gallantry <i>à la</i> Watteau, or of windy
mouthings about Cause and Effect, Duties and Principles,
Reason and Nature. But, to begin with, neither
estimate comes near the mark; and, moreover, Stendhal
hated Voltaire almost as much as Blake did. It was not
an indiscriminate cry of Rights and Liberty which
interested Stendhal in the eighteenth century. The old
<i>régime</i> was, of course, politically uncongenial to him, the
liberal and Bonapartist, and he could see the stupidity
and injustice and hollowness of a society built up on
privilege. But even if Stendhal, like the happy optimist
of to-day, had mistaken the hatred of past wrongs for
a proof of present well-being, how could a student of
Love fail to be fascinated by an age such as that of
Lewis XV? It was the leisure for loving, which, as he
was always remarking, court-life and only court-life
makes possible, that reconciled him to an age he really
despised. Moreover, the mass of memoirs and letters
of the distinguished men and women of the eighteenth
century, offering as it does material for the study of
manners unparalleled in any other age, inevitably led
him back to the court-life of the <i>ancien régime</i>.
Besides, as has been already suggested, the contradiction
in Stendhal was strong. In spite of his liberalism, he
was pleased in later life to add the aristocratic "de" to
the name of Beyle. With Lord Byron, divided in heart
between the generous love of liberty which led him to
fight for the freedom of Greece, and disgust at the
vulgarity of the Radical party, which he had left behind
in England, Stendhal found himself closely in sympathy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>when they met in Italy. It was the originality<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of the
men of the sixteenth century which called forth his
genuine praises; even the statesmen-courtiers and
soldiers of the heroic age of Lewis XIV awoke his admiration;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
the gallant courtiers and incompetent
statesmen of Lewis XV awoke at least his interest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stendhal's <i>De l'Amour</i>, and in less degree his novels,
have had to struggle for recognition, and the cause has
largely been the peculiarity of his attitude&mdash;his scepticism,
the exaggerated severity of his treatment of idyllic
subjects, together with an unusual complement of sentiment
and appreciation of the value of sentiment for the
understanding of life. It is his manner of thinking,
much rather than the strangeness of his thoughts themselves,
which made the world hesitate to give Stendhal
the position which it now accords him. But at least
one great discovery the world did find in <i>De l'Amour</i>&mdash;a
novelty quite apart from general characteristics, apart
from its strange abruptness and stranger truth of detail.
Stendhal's discovery is "Crystallisation"; it is the central
idea of his book. The word was his invention, though the
thought, which it expresses so decisively, is to be found,
like most so-called advanced ideas, hidden away in a
corner of Montaigne's Essays.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Crystallisation is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>process by which we love an object for qualities, which
primarily exist in our fancy and which we lend to it,
that is to say, imaginary or unreal qualities. While
Montaigne, and others no doubt, had seen in this a
peculiarity of love, Stendhal saw in it love's essential
characteristic&mdash;one might say, its explanation, if love
were capable of being explained. Besides, in this book
Stendhal is seeking the <i>how</i> not the <i>why</i> of love. And
he goes beyond love: he recognises the influence of
crystallisation upon other sides of life besides love.
Crystallisation has become an integral part of the world's
equipment for thought and expression.</p>

<p>The crisis in Stendhal's posthumous history is Sainte-Beuve's
<i>Causeries des Lundis</i> of January 2nd and 9th,
1854, of which Stendhal was the subject. Stendhal died
in 1842. It is sometimes said that his reputation is a
fictitious reputation, intentionally worked up by partisanship
and without regard to merit, that in his lifetime
he was poorly thought of. This is untrue. His artistic
activities, like his military, were appreciated by those
competent to judge them. He was complimented by
Napoleon on his services prior to the retreat from Moscow;
Balzac, who of all men was capable of judging a novel
and, still more, a direct analysis of a passion, was one of
his admirers, and particularly an admirer of <i>De l'Amour</i>.
From the general public he met to a great extent with
mistrust, and for a few years after his death his memory
was honoured with apathetic silence. The few, a
chosen public and some faithful friends&mdash;Mérimée and
others&mdash;still cherished his reputation. In 1853, owing
in great measure to the efforts of Romain Colomb and
Louis Crozet, a complete edition of his works was published
by Michel-Lévy. And then, very appropriately,
early in the next year was heard the impressive judgment
of Sainte-Beuve. Perhaps the justest remark in that just
appreciation is where he gives Stendhal the merit of
being one of the first Frenchmen to travel <i>littérairement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>parlant</i>.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Stendhal came back from each of his
many and frequent voyages, like the happy traveller in
Joachim du Bellay's sonnet, <i>plein d'usage et raison</i>&mdash;knowing
the ways of men and full of ripe wisdom.
And this is true not only of his travels over land and
sea, but also of those into the thoughtful world of
books.</p>

<p>An equally true&mdash;perhaps still truer&mdash;note was struck
by Sainte-Beuve, when he insisted on the important place
in Stendhal's character played by <i>la peur d'être dupe</i>&mdash;the
fear of being duped. Stendhal was always and in
all situations beset by this fear; it tainted his happiest
moments and his best qualities. We have already remarked
on the effect on his style of his mistrust of himself&mdash;it
is the same characteristic. A sentimental
romantic by nature, he was always on his guard against
the follies of a sentimental outlook; a sceptic by education
and the effect of his age, he was afraid of being
the dupe of his doubts; he was sceptical of scepticism
itself. This tended to make him unreal and affected,
made him often defeat his own ends in the oddest way.
In order to avoid the possibility of being carried away
too far along a course, in which instinct led him, he would
choose a direction approved instead by his intellect, only
to find out too late that he was cutting therein a sorry
figure. Remember, as a boy he made his entrance into
the world "with the fixed intention of being a seducer of
women," and that, late in life, he made the melancholy
confession that his normal role was that of the lover
crossed in love. Here lies the commentary on not a
little in Stendhal's life and works.</p>

<p>The facts of his life can be told very briefly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Henry Beyle, who wrote under the name of Stendhal,
was born at Grenoble in 1783, and was educated in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>native town. In 1799 he came to Paris and was placed
there under the protection of Daru, an important officer
under Napoleon, a relative and patron of his family.
But he showed no fitness for the various kinds of office
work to which he was put. He tried his hand at this
time, unsuccessfully also, at painting.</p>

<p>In 1800, still under the protection of Daru, he went
to Italy, and, having obtained a commission in the 6th
regiment of Dragoons, had his first experience of active
service. By 1802 he had distinguished himself as a
soldier, and it was to the general surprise of all who
knew him, that he returned to France on leave, handed
in his papers and returned to Grenoble.</p>

<p>He soon returned to Paris, there to begin serious study.
But in 1806, he was once more with Daru and the army,&mdash;present
at the triumphal entry of Napoleon into Berlin.
It was directly after this that he was sent to Brunswick
as assistant <i>commissaire des guerres</i>.</p>

<p>He left Brunswick in 1809, but after a flying visit to
Paris, he was again given official employment in Germany.
He was with the army at Vienna. After the peace of
Schoenbrunn he returned once more to Paris in 1810.</p>

<p>In 1812, he saw service once more&mdash;taking an active
and distinguished part in the Russian campaign of
that year. He was complimented by Napoleon on the
way he had discharged his duties in the commissariat.
He witnessed the burning of Moscow and shared in the
horrors and hardships of the retreat.</p>

<p>In 1813 his duties brought him to Segan in Silesia, and
in 1814 to his native town of Grenoble.</p>

<p>The fall of Napoleon in the same year deprived him
of his position and prospects. He went to Milan and
stayed there with little interruption till 1821; only
leaving after these, the happiest, years of his life, through
fear of being implicated in the Carbonari troubles.</p>

<p>In 1830, he was appointed to the consulate of Trieste;
but Metternich, who, no doubt, mistrusted his liberal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>tendencies, refused to ratify his appointment, and he
was transferred to Civita Vecchia. This unhealthy district
tried his health, and frequent travel did not succeed
in repairing it.</p>

<p>In 1841, he was on leave in Paris, where he died
suddenly in the following year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Stendhal's best-known books are his two novels: <i>La
Chartreuse de Parme</i> and <i>Le Rouge et le Noir</i>. Besides
these there are his works of travel&mdash;<i>Promenades dans
Rome</i> and <i>Rome, Florence et Naples</i>; <i>Mémoire d'un
Touriste</i>; his history of Italian painting; his lives of
Haydn, Mozart and Rossini; <i>L'Abbesse de Castro</i> and
other minor works of fiction; finally a number of autobiographical
works, of which <i>La Vie de Henri Brulard</i>,
begun in his fiftieth year and left incomplete, is the
most important.</p>

<p>But <i>De l'Amour</i>, Stendhal himself considered his most
important work; it was written, as he tells us, in his happy
years in Lombardy. It was published on his return to
Paris in 1822, but it had no success, and copies of this
edition are very rare. Recently it has been reprinted
by Messrs. J. M. Dent and Sons (in <i>Chef d'Œuvres de la
Littérature Française</i>, London and Paris, 1912). The
second edition (1833) had no more success than the first
and is equally difficult to find. Stendhal was preparing
a third edition for the press when he died in 1842. In
1853 the work made a new appearance in the edition of
Stendhal's works published by Michel-Lévy, since reprinted
by Calmann-Lévy. It contains certain additions,
some of which Stendhal probably intended for the
new edition, which he was planning at the time of his
death.</p>

<p>Within the last year have appeared the first volumes
of a new French edition of Stendhal's works, published
by Messrs. Honoré and Edouard Champion of Paris.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>It will be the most complete edition of Stendhal's works
yet published and is the surest evidence that Stendhal's
position in French literature is now assured. The
volume containing <i>De l'Amour</i> has not yet appeared.</p>

<p>The basis of this translation is the first edition, to
which we have only added three prefaces, written by
Stendhal at various, subsequent dates and all well worth
perusal. Apart from these, we have preferred to leave
the book just as it appeared in the two editions, which
were published in Stendhal's own lifetime.</p>

<p>We may, perhaps, add a word with regard to our
notes at the end of the book. We make no claim that
they are exhaustive: we intended only to select some
few points for explanation or illustration, with the
English reader in view. Here and there in this book
are sentences and allusions which we can no more
explain than could Stendhal himself, when in 1822 he
was correcting the proof-sheets: as he did, we have left
them, preferring to believe with him that "the fault
lay with the self who was reading, not with the self who
had written." But, these few enigmas aside&mdash;and they
are very few&mdash;to make an exhaustive collection of notes
on this book would be to write another volume&mdash;one of
those volumes of "Notes and Appendices," under which
scholars bury a Pindar or Catullus. That labour we
will gladly leave to others&mdash;to be accomplished, we
hope, a thousand years hence, when French also is a
"dead" language.</p>

<p>In conclusion we should like to express our thanks to
our friend Mr. W. H. Morant, of the India Office, who
has helped us to see the translation through the Press.</p>

We cannot here forgo quoting one more passage from Montaigne,
which bears distinctly upon other important views of Stendhal. "I
say that Males and Females are cast in the same Mould and that, Education
and Usage excepted, the Difference is not great.... It is much
more easy to accuse one Sex than to excuse the other. 'Tis according to
the Proverb&mdash;'Ill may Vice correct Sin.'" (Bk. Ill, Chap. V).</p></div>

<h2>PREFACE<a name="FNanchor_1_20" id="FNanchor_1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_20" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>It is in vain that an author solicits the indulgence of
his public&mdash;the printed page is there to give the
lie to his pretended modesty. He would do better to
trust to the justice, patience and impartiality of his
readers, and it is to this last quality especially that the
author of the present work makes his appeal. He has
often heard people in France speak of writings, opinions
or sentiments as being "truly French"; and so he
may well be afraid that, by presenting facts truly
as they are, and showing respect only for sentiments
and opinions that are universally true, he may have
provoked that jealous exclusiveness, which, in spite of
its very doubtful character, we have seen of late set up
as a virtue. What, I wonder, would become of history,
of ethics, of science itself or of literature, if they had to
be truly German, truly Russian or Italian, truly Spanish
or English, as soon as they had crossed the Rhine, the
Alps or the Channel? What are we to say to this kind
of justice, to this ambulatory truth? When we see
such expressions as "devotion truly Spanish," "virtues
truly English," seriously employed in the speeches of
patriotic foreigners, it is high time to suspect this sentiment,
which expresses itself in very similar terms also
elsewhere. At Constantinople or among savages, this
blind and exclusive partiality for one's own country is a
rabid thirst for blood; among civilised peoples, it is a
morbid, unhappy, restless vanity, that is ready to turn
on you for a pinprick.<a name="FNanchor_2_21" id="FNanchor_2_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_21" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<h2>PREFACE<a name="FNanchor_1_22" id="FNanchor_1_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_22" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>


<p>ThiS work has had no success: it has been found
unintelligible&mdash;not without reason. Therefore
in this new edition the author's primary intention has
been to render his ideas with clearness. He has related
how they came to him, and he has made a preface and
an introduction&mdash;all in order to be clear. Yet, in spite
of so much care, out of a hundred who have read <i>Corinne</i>,
there are not four readers who will understand this
volume.</p>

<p>Although it deals with Love, this little book is no novel,
and still less is it diverting like a novel. 'Tis simply and
solely an exact scientific description of a kind of madness
which is very rarely to be found in France. The Empire
of propriety, growing day by day wider, under the
influence of our fear of ridicule much more than through
the purity of our morals, has made of the word, which
serves as title to this work, an expression, of which outspoken
mention is avoided and which at times seems even
to give offence. I have been forced to make use of it,
but the scientific austerity of the language shelters me,
I think, in this respect, from all reproach.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I know one or two Secretaries of Legation who will,
at their return, be able to tender me their services. Till
then what can I say to the people who deny the facts
of my narration? Beg them not to listen to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>The form I have adopted may be reproached with
egoism. A traveller is allowed to say: "<i>I</i> was at New
York, thence <i>I</i> embarked for South America, <i>I</i> made
my way back as far as Santa-Fé-de-Bogota. The gnats
and mosquitoes made <i>my</i> life a misery during the journey,
and for three days <i>I</i> couldn't use <i>my</i> right eye."</p>

<p>The traveller is not accused of loving to talk of himself:
all his <i>me's</i> and <i>my's</i> are forgiven; for that is the
clearest and most interesting manner of telling what he
has seen.</p>

<p>It is in order, if possible, to be clear and picturesque,
that the author of the present voyage into the little-known
regions of the human heart says: "I went with
Mme. Gherardi to the salt mines of Hallein....
Princess Crescenzi said to me at Rome.... One day at
Berlin I saw handsome Capt. L...." All these little
things really happened to the author, who passed fifteen
years in Germany and Italy. But more observant than
sensitive, he never encountered the least adventure himself,
never experienced a single personal sentiment worthy
of narration. Even supposing that he had the pride to
believe the contrary, a still greater pride would have
prevented him from publishing his heart and selling it
on the market for six francs, like those people who in
their lifetime publish their memoirs.</p>

<p>Correcting in 1822 the proofs of this kind of moral
voyage in Italy and Germany, the author, who had described
the objects the day that he had seen them,
treated the manuscript, containing the detailed description
of all the phases of this malady of the soul called
Love, with that blind respect, shown by a scholar of
the fourteenth century for a newly unearthed manuscript
of Lactantius or Quintius Curtius. When the
author met some obscure passage (and often, to say the
truth, that happened), he always believed that the fault
lay with the self who was reading, not with the self
who had written. He confesses that his respect for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>early manuscript carried him so far as to print several
passages, which he did not understand himself. Nothing
more foolish for anyone who had thought of the good
graces of the public; but the author, seeing Paris again
after long travels, came to the conclusion that without
grovelling before the Press a success was not to be had.
Well, let him who brings himself to grovel keep that for
the minister in power! A so-called success being out of
the question, the author was pleased to publish his
thoughts exactly as they had come to him. This was
once upon a time the procedure of those philosophers of
Greece, whose practical wisdom filled him with rapturous
admiration.</p>

<p>It requires years to gain admittance to the inner circle
of Italian society. Perhaps I shall have been the last
traveller in that country. For since the <i>Carbonari</i> and
the Austrian invasion, no foreigner will ever be received
as a friend in the <i>salons</i>, where such reckless gaiety
reigned. The traveller will see the monuments, streets
and public places of a city, never the society&mdash;he will
always be held in fear: the inhabitants will suspect that
he is a spy, or fear that he is laughing at the battle of
Antrodoco and at the degradations, which, in that land,
are the one and only safeguard against the persecution of
the eight or ten ministers or favourites who surround
the Prince. Personally, I really loved the inhabitants
and could see the truth. Sometimes for ten months
together I never spoke a word of French, and but for
political troubles and the <i>Carbonari</i> I would never have
returned to France. Good-nature is what I prize above
all things.</p>

<p>In spite of great care to be clear and lucid, I cannot
perform miracles: I cannot give ears to the deaf nor
eyes to the blind. So the people of great fortunes and
gross pleasures, who have made a hundred thousand
francs in the year preceding the moment they open this
book, had better quickly shut it, especially if they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>bankers, manufacturers, respectable industrial folk&mdash;that's
to say, people with eminently positive ideas. This book
would be less unintelligible to anyone who had made a
large sum of money on the Stock Exchange or in a lottery.
Such winnings may be found side by side with the habit
of passing hours together in day-dreams, in the enjoyment
of the emotion evoked by a picture of Prud'hon, a
phrase of Mozart, still more, a certain peculiar look of a
woman who is often in your thoughts. 'Tis not in this
way that these people "waste their time," who pay
ten thousand workmen at the end of each week: their
minds work always towards the useful and the positive.
The dreamer, of whom I speak, is the man they would
hate, if they had time; 'tis him they like to make the
butt of their harmless jokes. The industrial millionaire
feels confusedly that such a man has more <i>estime</i> for
a thought than for a bag of money.</p>

<p>I invite the studious young man to withdraw, if in
the same year as the industrial gained a hundred thousand
francs, he has acquired the knowledge of modern Greek,
and is so proud of it that already he aspires to Arabic.
I beg not to open this book every man, who has not been
unhappy for imaginary reasons, reasons to which vanity
is stranger, and which he would be very ashamed to see
divulged in the <i>salons</i>.</p>

<p>I am sure to displease those women who capture the
consideration of these very <i>salons</i> by an affectation that
never lapses for an instant. Some of these for a moment
I have surprised in good earnest, and so astonished, that,
asking themselves the question, they could no longer tell
whether such and such a sentiment, as they had just
expressed, was natural or affected. How could such
women judge of the portraiture of real feelings? In
fact this work has been their <i>bête noire</i>: they say that
the author must be a wretch.</p>

<p>To blush suddenly at the thought of certain youthful
doings; to have committed follies through sensibility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>and to suffer for them, not because you cut a silly figure
in the eyes of the <i>salon</i>, but in the eyes of a certain
person in the <i>salon</i>; to be in love at the age of twenty-six
in good earnest with a woman who loves another, or
even (but the case is so rare that I scarcely dare write it,
for fear of sinking again into the unintelligible, as in the
first edition)&mdash;or even to enter the <i>salon</i> where the woman
is whom you fancy that you love, and to think only of
reading in her eyes her opinion of you at the moment,
without any idea of putting on a love-lorn expression
yourself&mdash;these are the antecedents I shall ask of my
reader. The description of many of these rare and subtle
feelings has appeared obscure to people with positive
ideas. How manage to be clear in their eyes? Tell
them of a rise of fifty centimes or a change in the tariff
of Columbia.<a name="FNanchor_2_23" id="FNanchor_2_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_23" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The book before you explains simply and mathematically,
so to speak, the curious feelings which succeed
each other and form a whole called the Passion of Love.</p>

<p>Imagine a fairly complicated geometrical figure, drawn
with white chalk on a large blackboard. Well, I am
going to explain that geometrical figure, but on one
condition&mdash;that it exists already on the blackboard, for
I personally cannot draw it. It is this impossibility that
makes it so difficult to write on Love a book which is not
a novel. In order to follow with interest a philosophic
examination of this feeling, something is wanted in the
reader besides understanding: it is absolutely necessary
that Love has been seen by him. But then where can a
passion be seen?</p>

<p>This is a cause of obscurity that I shall never be able
to eliminate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Love resembles what we call the Milky Way in heaven,
a gleaming mass formed by thousands of little stars, each
of which may be a nebula. Books have noted four or
five hundred of the little feelings hanging together and
so hard to recognise, which compose this passion. But
even in these, the least refined, they have often blundered
and taken the accessory for the principal. The best of
these books, such as the <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i>, the novels of
Madame Cottin, the Letters of Mademoiselle de Lespinasse
and <i>Manon Lescaut</i>, have been written in France,
where the plant called Love is always in fear of ridicule,
is overgrown by the demands of vanity, the national
passion, and reaches its full height scarcely ever.</p>

<p>What is a knowledge of Love got from novels? After
seeing it described&mdash;without ever feeling it&mdash;in hundreds
of celebrated volumes, what is to be said of seeking in
mine the explanation of this madness? I answer like
an echo: "'Tis madness."</p>

<p>Poor disillusioned young lady, would you enjoy again
that which busied you so some years ago, which you
dared mention to no one, which almost cost you your
honour? It is for you that I have refashioned this book
and tried to make it clearer. After reading it, never
speak of it without a little scornful turn, and throw it
in your citron bookcase behind the other books&mdash;I
should even leave a few pages uncut.</p>

<p>'Tis not only a few pages that will be left uncut by
the imperfect creature, who thinks himself philosopher,
because he has remained always stranger to those reckless
emotions, which cause all our happiness of a week to
depend upon a glance. Some people, coming to the age
of discretion, use the whole force of their vanity to forget
that there was a day when they were able to stoop so
low as to court a woman and expose themselves to the
humiliation of a refusal: this book will win their hatred.
Among the many clever people, whom I have seen condemn
this work, for different reasons but all angrily,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>those only seemed to me ridiculous, who had the twofold
conceit to pretend always to have been above the weakness
of sensibility, and yet to possess enough penetration
to judge <i>a priori</i> of the degree of exactitude of a philosophic
treatise, which is nothing but an ordered description
of these weaknesses.</p>

<p>The grave persons, who enjoy in society their reputation
as safe men with no romantic nonsense, are far nearer
to the understanding of a novel, however impassioned,
than of a book of philosophy, wherein the author describes
coldly the various stages of the malady of the
soul called Love. The novel moves them a little; but
before the philosophic treatise these sensible people are
like blind men, who getting a description of the pictures
in a museum read out to them, would say to the author:
"You must agree, sir, that your work is horribly obscure."
What is to happen if these blind men chance to be wits,
established long since in possession of that title and with
sovereign claims to clairvoyance? The poor author will
be treated prettily. In fact, it is what happened to him
at the time of the first edition. Several copies were
actually burnt through the raging vanity of very clever
people. I do not speak of insults all the more flattering
for their fury: the author was proclaimed to be coarse,
immoral, a writer for the people, a suspicious character,
etc. In countries outworn by monarchy, these titles are
the surest reward for whoever thinks good to write on
morals and does not dedicate his book to the Mme.
Dubarry of the day. Blessed literature, if it were not
in fashion, and interested those alone for whom it was
written!</p>

<p>In the time of the <i>Cid</i>, Corneille was nothing for
M. le Marquis de Danjeau<a name="FNanchor_3_24" id="FNanchor_3_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_24" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but "a good fellow." Today
the whole world thinks itself made to read M. de
Lamartine: so much the better for his publisher, but
so much the worse, and a hundred times the worse, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>that great poet. In our days genius offers accommodation
to people to whom, under penalty of losing caste,
it should never so much as give a thought.</p>

<p>The laborious and active, very estimable and very
positive life of a counsellor of State, of a manufacturer
of cotton goods or of a banker with a keen eye for loans
finds its reward in millions, not in tender sensation.
Little by little the heart of these gentlemen ossifies:
the positive and the useful are for them everything, and
their soul is closed to that feeling, which of all others has
the greatest need of our leisure and makes us most unfit
for any rational and steady occupation.</p>

<p>The only object of this preface is to proclaim that
this book has the misfortune of being incomprehensible
to all who have not found time to play the fool. Many
people will feel offended and I trust they will go no
further.</p>

<p>I write for a hundred readers only and of these
unhappy charming beings, without hypocrisy or
moral cant, whom I would please, I know scarcely a
couple. Of such as lie to gain consideration as writers, I
take little heed. Certain fine ladies should keep to the
accounts of their cook and the fashionable preacher of
the day, be it Massillon or Mme. Necker, to be able to
talk on these topics with the women of importance who
mete out consideration. And to be sure, in France this

In all your life have you been unhappy six months for
love?</p>

<p>Or, was your soul ever touched by sorrow not connected
with the thought of a lawsuit, with failure at the last
election, or with having cut a less brilliant figure than usual
last season at Aix? I will continue my indiscretions and
ask if in the year you have read any of those impudent
works, which compel the reader to think? For example,
<i>Émile</i> of J. J. Rousseau, or the six volumes of Montaigne?
If, I should say, you have never suffered through this infirmity
of noble minds, if you have not, in defiance of
nature, the habit of thinking as you read, this book will
give you a grudge against its author: for it will make
you suspect that there exists a certain happiness, unknown
to you and known to Mlle. de Lespinasse.</p>

<h2>PREFACE<a name="FNanchor_1_26" id="FNanchor_1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_26" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></h2>

<p>
I come to beg indulgence of the reader for the
peculiar form of this Physiology of Love. It is
twenty-eight years (in 1842) since the turmoil, which
followed the fall of Napoleon, deprived me of my
position. Two years earlier chance threw me, immediately
after the horrors of the retreat from Russia, into
the midst of a charming town, where I had the enchanting
prospect of passing the rest of my days. In happy
Lombardy, at Milan, at Venice, the great, or rather
only, business of life is pleasure. No attention, there,
to the deeds and movements of your neighbour; hardly
a troubled thought for what is to happen to you. If a
man notice the existence of his neighbour, it does not
enter his head to hate him. Take away from the occupations
of a French provincial town jealousy&mdash;and what is
left? The absence, the impossibility of that cruel
jealousy forms the surest part of that happiness, which
draws all the provincials to Paris.
</p>
<p>
Following the masked balls of Carnival, which in
1820 was more brilliant than usual, the noise of five or
six completely reckless proceedings occupied the society
of Milan an entire month; although they are used over
there to things which in France would pass for incredible.
The fear of ridicule would in this country paralyse such
fantastic actions: only to speak of them I need great
courage.
</p>
<p>
One evening people were discussing profoundly the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>effects and the causes of these extravagances, at the house
of the charming Mme. Pietra Grua<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_6">(6)</a></span>, who happened,
extraordinarily enough, not to be mixed up with these
escapades. The thought came to me that perhaps in
less than a year I should have nothing left of all those
strange facts, and of the causes alleged for them, but a
recollection, on which I could not depend. I got hold of
a concert programme, and wrote a few words on it in
pencil. A game of faro was suggested: we were thirty
seated round a card-table, but the conversation was so
animated that people forgot to play. Towards the close
of the evening came in Col. Scotti, one of the most
charming men in the Italian army: he was asked for his
quantum of circumstances relative to the curious facts
with which we were busy, and, indeed, his story of
certain things, which chance had confided to his knowledge,
gave them an entirely new aspect. I took up
my concert programme and added these new circumstances.
</p>
<p>
This collection of particulars on Love was continued in
the same way, with pencil and odd scraps of paper,
snatched up in the <i>salons</i>, where I heard the anecdotes
told. Soon I looked for a common rule by which to
recognise different degrees in them. Two months later
fear of being taken for a <i>Carbonaro</i> made me return to
Paris&mdash;only for a few months I hoped, but never again
have I seen Milan, where I had passed seven years.
</p>
<p>
Pining with boredom at Paris, I conceived the idea of
occupying myself again with the charming country from
which fear had driven me. I strung together my scraps
of paper and presented the book to a publisher. But
soon a difficulty was raised: the printer declared that it
was impossible to work from notes written in pencil
and I could see that he found such copy beneath his
dignity. The printer's young apprentice, who brought
me back my notes, seemed quite ashamed of the more
than doubtful compliment, which had been put into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>his mouth: he knew how to write and I dictated to
him my pencil notes.
</p>
<p>
I understood, too, that discretion required me to
change the proper names, and, above all, abridge the
anecdotes. Although no one reads in Milan, the book,
if ever it reached there, might have seemed a piece of
wicked mischief.
</p>
<p>
So I brought out an ill-fated volume. I have the
courage to own that I despised at that period elegance
in style. I saw the young apprentice wholly taken up
with avoiding sentence-endings that were unmusical and
odd sounds in the arrangement of words. In return,
he made throughout no scruple of changing details of
fact, difficult to express: Voltaire himself is afraid of
things which are difficult to tell.
</p>
<p>
The Essay on Love had no claim to merit except the
number of the fine shades of feeling, which I begged the
reader to verify among his memories, if he were happy
enough to have any. But in all this there was something
much worse: I was then, as ever, very inexperienced in
the department of literature and the publisher, to whom
I had presented the MS., printed it on bad paper and in
an absurd <i>format</i>. In fact a month later, when I asked
him for news of the book&mdash;"On peut dire qu'il est
sacré,"<a name="FNanchor_2_27" id="FNanchor_2_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_27" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he said, "For no one comes near it."
</p>
<p>
It had never even crossed my mind to solicit articles
in the papers: such a thing would have seemed to me
an ignominy. And yet no work was in more pressing
need of recommendation to the patience of the reader.
Under the menace of becoming unintelligible at the very
outset, it was necessary to bring the public to accept the
new word "crystallisation," suggested as a lively expression
for that collection of strange fancies, which we weave
round our idea of the loved one, as true and even indubitable
realities.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>At that time wholly absorbed in my love for the
least details, which I had lately observed in the Italy
of my dreams, I avoided with care every concession,
every amenity of style, which might have rendered the
Essay on Love less peculiarly fantastic in the eyes of men
of letters.
</p>
<p>
Further, I was not flattering to the public. Literature
at that time, all defaced by our great and recent misfortunes,
seemed to have no other interest than the
consolation of our unhappy pride: it used to rhyme
"<i>gloire</i>" with "<i>victoire</i>," "<i>guerriers</i>" with "<i>lauriers</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_3_28" id="FNanchor_3_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_28" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
etc. The true circumstances of the situations, which it
pretends to treat, seem never to have any attraction for
the tedious literature of that period: it looks for nothing
but an opportunity of complimenting that people,
enslaved to fashion, whom a great man had called a great
nation, forgetting that they were only great on condition
that their leader was himself.
</p>
<p>
As the result of my ignorance of the exigencies of the
humblest success, I found no more than seventeen readers
between 1822 and 1833: it is doubtful whether the
Essay on Love has been understood after twenty years
of existence by a hundred connoisseurs. A few have had
the patience to observe the various phases of this disease
in the people infected with it in their circle; for we
must speak of it as a disease, in order to understand that
passion which in the last thirty years our fear of ridicule
has taken so much trouble to hide&mdash;it is this way which
sometimes leads to its cure.
</p>
<p>
Now and now only, after half a century of revolutions,
engrossing one after another our whole attention,
now and now only after five complete changes in the
form and the tendencies of our government, does the
revolution just begin to show itself in our way of living.
Love, or that which commonly appropriates Love's
name and fills its place, was all-powerful in the France of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>Lewis XV. Colonels were created by the ladies of the
court; and that court was nothing less than the fairest
place in the kingdom. Fifty years after, the court is
no more; and the gift of a licence to sell tobacco in the
meanest provincial town is beyond the power of the
most surely established ladies of the reigning <i>bourgeoisie</i>
or of the pouting nobility.
</p>
<p>
It must be owned, women are out of fashion. In
our brilliant <i>salons</i> the young men of twenty affect
not to address them; they much prefer to stand
round the noisy talker dealing, in a provincial accent,
with the question of the right to vote, and to try and
slip in their own little word. The rich youths, who,
to keep up a show of the good-fellowship of past times,
take a pride in seeming frivolous, prefer to talk horses
and play high in the circles where women are excluded.
The deadly indifference which seems to preside over the
relations of young men and the women of five-and-twenty,
for whose presence society has to thank the boredom
of marriage, will bring, perhaps, a few wise spirits
to accept this scrupulously exact description of the
successive phases of the malady called Love.
</p>
<p>
Seeing the terrible change which has plunged us into
the stagnation of to-day, and makes unintelligible to us
the society of 1778, such as we find it in the letters of
Diderot to Mlle. Voland, his mistress, or in the Memoirs
of Madame d'Épinay, a man might ask the question,
which of our successive governments has killed in us the
faculty of enjoying ourselves, and drawn us nearer to
the gloomiest people on the face of the earth? The only
passable thing which that people have invented&mdash;parliament
and the honesty of their parties&mdash;we are unable
even to copy. In return, the stupidest of their gloomy
conceptions, the spirit of dignity, has come among us to
take the place of our French gaiety, which is to be found
now only in the five hundred balls in the outskirts of Paris
or in the south of France, beyond Bordeaux.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>But which of our successive governments has cost us
the fearful misfortune of anglicisation? Must we accuse
that energetic government of 1793, which prevented
the foreigners from coming to pitch their camp in Montmartre&mdash;that
government which in a few years will seem
heroic in our eyes and forms a worthy prelude to that,
which under Napoleon, went forth to carry our name
into all the capitals of Europe?
</p>
<p>
We shall pass over the well-meaning stupidity of the
<i>Directoire</i>, illustrated by the talents of Carnot and the
immortal campaign of 1796&ndash;1797 in Italy.
</p>
<p>
The corruption of the court of Barras still recalled
something of the gaiety of the old order; the graces of
Madame Bonaparte proved that we had no aptitude at
that time for the churlishness and charnel-house of the
English.
</p>
<p>
The profound respect, which despite the jealousy of
the faubourg Saint-Germain, we could not but feel for
the First Consul's method of government, and the men
whose superior merit adorned the society of Paris&mdash;such
as the Cretets and the Darus&mdash;relieves the Empire
of the burden of responsibility for the remarkable change
which has been effected, in the first half of the nineteenth
century, in the character of the French.
</p>
<p>
Unnecessary to carry my investigation further: the
reader will reflect and be quite able to draw his own
conclusions.

<p class="title">ON LOVE</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF LOVE</span></h3>

<p>
My aim is to comprehend that passion, of which every
sincere development has a character of beauty.
</p>
<p>
There are four kinds of love.
</p>
<p>
1. Passion-love&mdash;that of the Portuguese nun<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_1" id="TNanch_1"></a><a href="#TN_1">(1)</a></span>, of
Héloïse for Abelard, of Captain de Vésel, of Sergeant de
Cento.
</p>
<p>
2. Gallant love&mdash;that which ruled in Paris towards
1760, to be found in the memoirs and novels of the
period, in Crébillon, Lauzun, Duclos, Marmontel, Chamfort,
Mme. d'Épinay, etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
'Tis a picture in which everything, to the very shadows,
should be rose-colour, in which may enter nothing disagreeable
under any pretext whatsoever, at the cost of a
lapse of etiquette, of good taste, of refinement, etc. A
man of breeding foresees all the ways of acting, that he is
likely to adopt or meet with in the different phases of
this love. True love is often less refined; for that in
which there is no passion and nothing unforeseen, has
always a store of ready wit: the latter is a cold and
pretty miniature, the former a picture by the Carracci.
Passion-love carries us away in defiance of all our interests,
gallant love manages always to respect them. True, if
we take from this poor love its vanity, there is very little
left: once stripped, it is like a tottering convalescent,
scarcely able to drag himself along.
</p>
<p>
3. Physical love. Out hunting&mdash;a fresh, pretty country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>girl crosses your path and escapes into the wood. Everyone
knows the love founded on this kind of pleasure:
and all begin that way at sixteen, however parched and
unhappy the character.
</p>
<p>
4. Vanity-love. The vast majority of men, especially
in France, desire and have a fashionable woman, in the
same way as a man gets a fine horse, as something which
the luxury of a young man demands. Their vanity more
or less flattered, more or less piqued, gives birth to transports
of feelings. Sometimes there is also physical love,
but by no means always: often there is not so much as
physical pleasure. A duchess is never more than thirty
for a bourgeois, said the Duchesse de Chaulnes, and those
admitted to the Court of that just man, king Lewis of
Holland, recall with amusement a pretty woman from
the Hague, who could not help finding any man charming
who was Duke or Prince. But true to the principle of
monarchy, as soon as a Prince arrived at Court, the Duke
was dismissed: she was, as it were, the decoration of the
diplomatic body.
</p>
<p>
The happiest case of this uninspiring relationship is
that in which to physical pleasure is added habit. In that
case store of memories makes it resemble love a little;
there is the pique of self-esteem and sadness on being
left; then, romance forces upon us its ideas and we
believe that we are in love and melancholy, for vanity
aspires to credit itself with a great passion. This, at
least, is certain that, whatever kind of love be the source
of pleasure, as soon as the soul is stirred, the pleasure is
keen and its memory alluring, and in this passion, contrary
to most of the others, the memory of our losses
seems always to exceed the bounds of what we can hope
for in the future.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, in vanity-love habit or despair of finding
better produces a kind of friendship, of all kinds the
least pleasant: it prides itself on its security, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1_29" id="FNanchor_1_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_29" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>Physical pleasure, being of our nature, is known to
everybody, but it takes no more than a subordinate
position in the eyes of tender and passionate souls. If
they raise a laugh in the salons, if often they are made
unhappy in the intrigues of society, in return the pleasure
which they feel must remain always inaccessible to those
hearts, whose beat only vanity and gold can quicken.
</p>
<p>
A few virtuous and sensitive women have scarcely a
conception of physical pleasures: they have so rarely
risked them, if one may use the expression, and even then
the transports of passion-love caused bodily pleasure
almost to be forgotten.
</p>
<p>
There are men victims and instruments of diabolical
pride, of a pride in the style of Alfieri. Those people
who, perhaps, are cruel because, like Nero, judging all
men after the pattern of their own heart, they are always
a-tremble&mdash;such people, I say, can attain physical
pleasure only in so far as it is accompanied by the greatest
possible exercise of pride, in so far, that is to say, as they
practise cruelties on the companion of their pleasures.
Hence the horrors of <i>Justine</i><span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_2" id="TNanch_2"></a><a href="#TN_2">(2)</a></span>. At any rate such
men have no sense of security.
</p>
<p>
To conclude, instead of distinguishing four different
forms of love, we can easily admit eight or ten shades
of difference. Perhaps mankind has as many ways of
feeling as of seeing; but these differences of nomenclature
alter in no degree the judgments which follow.
Subject to the same laws, all forms of love, which can
be seen here below, have their birth, life and death or
ascend to immortality.<a name="FNanchor_2_30" id="FNanchor_2_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_30" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF THE BIRTH OF LOVE</span></h3>

<p>
This is what takes place in the soul:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
1. Admiration.
</p>
<p>
2. A voice within says: "What pleasure to kiss, to be
kissed."
</p>
<p>
3. Hope<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_3" id="TNanch_3"></a><a href="#TN_3">(3)</a></span>.
</p>
<p>
We study her perfections: this is the moment at
which a woman should yield to realise the greatest
possible physical pleasure. In the case even of the most
reserved women, their eyes redden at the moment when
hope is conceived: the passion is so strong, the pleasure
so keen, that it betrays itself by striking signs.
</p>
<p>
4. Love is born.
</p>
<p>
To love&mdash;that is to have pleasure in seeing, touching,
feeling, through all the senses and as near as possible, an
object to be loved and that loves us.
</p>
<p>
5. The first crystallisation begins.
</p>
<p>
The lover delights in decking with a thousand perfections
the woman of whose love he is sure: he dwells
on all the details of his happiness with a satisfaction
that is boundless. He is simply magnifying a superb
bounty just fallen to him from heaven,&mdash;he has no
knowledge of it but the assurance of its possession.
</p>
<p>
Leave the mind of a lover to its natural movements
for twenty-four hours, and this is what you will find.
</p>
<p>
At the salt mines of Salzburg a branch stripped of its
leaves by winter is thrown into the abandoned depths
of the mine; taken out two or three months later it is
covered with brilliant crystals; the smallest twigs, those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>no stouter than the leg of a sparrow, are arrayed with an
infinity of sparkling, dazzling diamonds; it is impossible
to recognise the original branch.
</p>
<p>
I call crystallisation the operation of the mind which,
from everything which is presented to it, draws the conclusion
that there are new perfections in the object of
its love.
</p>
<p>
A traveller speaks of the freshness of the orange groves
at Genoa, on the sea coast, during the scorching days of
summer.&mdash;What pleasure to enjoy that freshness with her!
</p>
<p>
One of your friends breaks his arm in the hunting-field.&mdash;How
sweet to be nursed by a woman you love!
To be always with her, to see every moment her love for
you, would make pain almost a blessing: and starting
from the broken arm of your friend, you conclude with
the absolute conviction of the angelic goodness of your
mistress. In a word, it is enough to think of a perfection
in order to see it in that which you love.
</p>
<p>
This phenomenon, which I venture to call crystallisation,
is the product of human nature, which commands
us to enjoy and sends warm blood rushing to our brain;
it springs from the conviction that the pleasures of love
increase with the perfections of its object, and from the
idea: "She is mine." The savage has no time to go
beyond the first step. He is delighted, but his mental
activity is employed in following the flying deer in the
forest, and with the flesh with which he must as soon as
possible repair his forces, or fall beneath the axe of his
enemy.
</p>
<p>
At the other pole of civilisation, I have no doubt that
a sensitive woman may come to the point of feeling no
physical pleasure but with the man she loves.<a name="FNanchor_1_31" id="FNanchor_1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_31" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is the
opposite with the savage. But among civilised peoples,
woman has leisure at her disposal, while the savage is so
pressed with necessary occupations that he is forced to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>treat his female as a beast of burden. If the females
of many animals are more fortunate, it is because the
subsistence of the males is more assured.
</p>
<p>
But let us leave the backwoods again for Paris. A man
of passion sees all perfections in that which he loves.
And yet his attention may still be distracted; for the
soul has its surfeit of all that is uniform, even of perfect
bliss.<a name="FNanchor_2_32" id="FNanchor_2_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_32" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
This is what happens to distract his attention:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
6. Birth of Doubt.
</p>
<p>
After ten or twelve glances, or some other series of
actions, which can last as well several days as one moment,
hopes are first given and later confirmed. The lover,
recovered from his first surprise and, accustomed to his
happiness or guided by theory, which, always based on
the most frequent cases, must only take light women
into account&mdash;the lover, I say, demands more positive
proofs and wishes to press his good fortune.
</p>
<p>
He is parried with indifference,<a name="FNanchor_3_33" id="FNanchor_3_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_33" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> coldness, even anger,
if he show too much assurance&mdash;in France a shade of
irony, which seems to say: "You are not quite as far
as you think."
</p>
<p>
A woman behaves in this way, either because she wakes
up from a moment of intoxication, and obeys the word
of modesty, which she trembles to have infringed, or
simply through prudence or coquetry.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>The lover comes to doubt of the happiness, to which
he looked forward: he scans more narrowly the reasons
that he fancied he had for hope.
</p>
<p>
He would like to fall back upon the other pleasures of
life, and finds them annihilated. He is seized with the
fear of a terrible disaster, and at the same time with a
profound preoccupation.
</p>
<p>
7. Second crystallisation.
</p>
<p>
Here begins the second crystallisation, which forms
diamonds out of the proofs of the idea&mdash;"She loves me."
</p>
<p>
The night which follows the birth of doubts, every
quarter of an hour, after a moment of fearful unhappiness,
the lover says to himself&mdash;"Yes, she loves me"&mdash;and
crystallisation has its turn, discovering new charms.
Then doubt with haggard eye grapples him and brings
him to a standstill, blank. His heart forgets to beat&mdash;"But
does she love me?" he says to himself. Between
these alternatives, agonising and rapturous, the poor
lover feels in his very soul: "She would give me
pleasures, which she alone can give me and no one else."
</p>
<p>
It is the palpability of this truth, this path on the
extreme edge of a terrible abyss and within touch, on
the other hand, of perfect happiness, which gives so
great a superiority to the second crystallisation over the
first.
</p>
<p>
The lover wanders from moment to moment between
these three ideas:&mdash;
</p>
<ol>
<li>She has every perfection.</li>
<li>She loves me.</li>
<li>What means of obtaining the greatest proof of her love?</li>
</ol>
<p>
The most agonising moment of love, still young, is
when it sees the false reasoning it has made, and must
destroy a whole span of crystallisation.
</p>
<p>
Doubt is the natural outcome of crystallisation.

It comes from the impossibility of this defensive manoeuvre. The woman
who loves finds too much happiness in the sentiment, which she feels, to
carry through successful deception: tired of prudence, she neglects all
precaution and yields blindly to the passion of loving. Diffidence makes

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF HOPE</span></h3>

<p>
A very small degree of hope is enough to cause the
birth of love.
</p>
<p>
In the course of events hope may fail&mdash;love is none
the less born. With a firm, daring and impetuous
character, and in an imagination developed by the troubles
of life, the degree of hope may be smaller: it can come
sooner to an end, without killing love.
</p>
<p>
If a lover has had troubles, if he is of a tender, thoughtful
character, if he despairs of other women, and if his
admiration is intense for her whom he loves, no ordinary
pleasure will succeed in distracting him from the second
crystallisation. He will prefer to dream of the most
doubtful chance of pleasing her one day, than to accept
from an ordinary woman all she could lavish.
</p>
<p>
The woman whom he loves would have to kill his
hope at that period, and (note carefully, not later) in
some inhuman manner, and overwhelm him with those
marks of patent contempt, which make it impossible to
appear again in public.
</p>
<p>
Far longer delays between all these periods are compatible
with the birth of love.
</p>
<p>
It demands much more hope and much more substantial
hope, in the case of the cold, the phlegmatic
and the prudent. The same is true of people no longer
young.
</p>
<p>
It is the second crystallisation which ensures love's
duration, for then every moment makes it clear that the
question is&mdash;be loved or die. Long months of love have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>turned into habit this conviction of our every moment&mdash;how
find means to support the thought of loving no
more? The stronger the character the less is it subject
to inconstancy.
</p>
<p>
This second crystallisation is almost entirely absent
from the passions inspired by women who yield too soon.
</p>
<p>
After the crystallisations have worked&mdash;especially the
second, which is far the stronger&mdash;the branch is no longer
to be recognised by indifferent eyes, for:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1) It is adorned with perfections which they do not
see.
</p>
<p>
(2) It is adorned with perfections which for them are
not perfections at all.
</p>
<p>
The perfection of certain charms, mentioned to him
by an old friend of his love, and a certain hint of liveliness
noticed in her eye, are a diamond in the crystallisation<a name="FNanchor_1_34" id="FNanchor_1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_34" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>of Del Rosso. These ideas, conceived during the evening,
keep him dreaming all the night.
</p>
<p>
An unexpected answer, which makes me see more
clearly a tender, generous, ardent, or, as it is popularly
called, romantic<a name="FNanchor_2_35" id="FNanchor_2_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_35" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> soul, preferring to the happiness of
kings the simple pleasures of a walk with the loved one
at midnight in a lonely wood, gives me food for dreams<a name="FNanchor_3_36" id="FNanchor_3_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_36" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
for a whole night.
</p>
<p>
Let him call my mistress a prude: I shall call his a
whore.

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_34" id="Footnote_1_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_34"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I have called this essay a book of Ideology. My object was to
indicate that, though it is called "Love," it is not a novel and still less
diverting like a novel. I apologise to philosophers for having taken the
word Ideology: I certainly did not intend to usurp a title which is the
right of another. If Ideology is a detailed description of ideas and all
the parts which can compose ideas, the present book is a detailed description
of all the feelings which can compose the passion called Love. Proceeding,
I draw certain consequences from this description: for example,
the manner of love's cure. I know no word to say in Greek "discourse
on ideas." I might have had a word invented by one of my learned
friends, but I am already vexed enough at having to adopt the new word
crystallisation, and, if this essay finds readers, it is quite possible that
they will not allow my new word to pass. To avoid it, I own, would have
been the work of literary talent: I tried, but without success. Without
this word, which expresses, according to me, the principal phenomenon
of that madness called Love&mdash;madness, however, which procures for man
the greatest pleasures which it is given to the beings of his species to taste
on earth&mdash;without the use of this word, which it were necessary to replace
at every step by a paraphrase of considerable length, the description,
which I give of what passes in the head and the heart of a man in love,
would have become obscure, heavy and tedious, even for me who am the
author: what would it have been for the reader?
</p>
<p>
I invite, therefore, the reader, whose feelings the word crystallisation
shocks too much, to close the book. To be read by many forms no part
of my prayers&mdash;happily, no doubt, for me. I should love dearly to give
great pleasure to thirty or forty people of Paris, whom I shall never see,
but for whom, without knowing, I have a blind affection. Some young
Madame Roland, for example, reading her book in secret and precious
quickly hiding it, at the least noise, in the drawers of her father's bench&mdash;her
father the engraver of watches. A soul like that of Madame Roland
will forgive me, I hope, not only the word crystallisation, used to express
that act of madness which makes us perceive every beauty, every kind
of perfection, in the woman whom we begin to love, but also several
too daring ellipses besides. The reader has only to take a pencil and write
between the lines the five or six words which are missing.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<p>
In a soul completely detached&mdash;a girl living in a
lonely castle in the depth of the country&mdash;the
slightest astonishment may bring on a slight admiration,
and, if the faintest hope intervene, cause the birth of
love and crystallisation<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_4" id="TNanch_4"></a><a href="#TN_4">(4)</a></span>.
</p>
<p>
In this case love delights, to begin with, just as a
diversion.
</p>
<p>
Surprise and hope are strongly supported by the need,
felt at the age of sixteen, of love and sadness. It is well
known that the restlessness of that age is a thirst for love,
and a peculiarity of thirst is not to be extremely fastidious
about the kind of draught that fortune offers.
</p>
<p>
Let us recapitulate the seven stages of love. They
are:&mdash;
</p>
<ol>
<li>Admiration.</li>

<li>What pleasure, etc.</li>

<li>Hope.</li>

<li>Love is born.</li>

<li>First crystallisation.</li>

<li>Doubt appears.</li>

<li>Second crystallisation.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Between Nos. 1 and 2 may pass one year. One month
between Nos. 2 and 3; but if hope does not make haste
in coming, No. 2 is insensibly resigned as a source of
unhappiness.
</p>
<p>
A twinkling of the eye between Nos. 3 and 4.
</p>
<p>
There is no interval between Nos. 4 and 5. The
sequence can only be broken by intimate intercourse.
</p>
<p>
Some days may pass between Nos. 5 and 6, according
to the degree to which the character is impetuous and used
to risk, but between Nos. 6 and 7 there is no interval.

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p>
Man is not free to avoid doing that which gives
him more pleasure to do than all other possible
actions.<a name="FNanchor_1_37" id="FNanchor_1_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_37" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
Love is like the fever<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_5" id="TNanch_5"></a><a href="#TN_5">(5)</a></span>, it is born and spends itself
without the slightest intervention of the will. That is
one of the principal differences between gallant-love and
passion-love. And you cannot give yourself credit for
the fair qualities in what you really love, any more than
for a happy chance.
</p>
<p>
Further, love is of all ages: observe the passion of
Madame du Deffant for the graceless Horace Walpole.
A more recent and more pleasing example is perhaps still
remembered in Paris.
</p>
<p>
In proof of great passions I admit only those of their
consequences, which are exposed to ridicule: timidity,
for example, proves love. I am not speaking of the
bashfulness of the enfranchised schoolboy.

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">THE CRYSTALS OF SALZBURG</span></h3>

<p>
Crystallisation scarcely ceases at all during
love. This is its history: so long as all is well
between the lover and the loved, there is crystallisation
by imaginary solution; it is only imagination which
make him sure that such and such perfection exists in
the woman he loves. But after intimate intercourse,
fears are continually coming to life, to be allayed only
by more real solutions. Thus his happiness is only uniform
in its source. Each day has a different bloom.
</p>
<p>
If the loved one yields to the passion, which she shares,
and falls into the enormous error of killing fear by the
eagerness of her transports,<a name="FNanchor_1_38" id="FNanchor_1_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_38" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> crystallisation ceases for an
instant; but when love loses some of its eagerness, that
is to say some of its fears, it acquires the charm of entire
abandon, of confidence without limits: a sense of
sweet familiarity comes to take the edge from all the
pains of life, and give to fruition another kind of interest.
</p>
<p>
Are you deserted?&mdash;Crystallisation begins again; and
every glance of admiration, the sight of every happiness
which she can give you, and of which you thought no
longer, leads up to this agonising reflexion: "That happiness,
that charm, I shall meet it no more. It is lost and
the fault is mine!" You may look for happiness in sensations
of another kind. Your heart refuses to feel them.
Imagination depicts for you well enough the physical
situation, mounts you well enough on a fast hunter in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>Devonshire woods.<a name="FNanchor_2_39" id="FNanchor_2_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_39" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But you feel quite certain that there
you would find no pleasure. It is the optical illusion
produced by a pistol shot.
</p>
<p>
Gaming has also its crystallisation, provoked by the
use of the sum of money to be won.
</p>
<p>
The hazards of Court life, so regretted by the nobility,
under the name of Legitimists, attached themselves so
dearly only by the crystallisation they provoked. No
courtier existed who did not dream of the rapid fortune
of a Luynes or a Lauzun, no charming woman who did
not see in prospect the duchy of Madame de Polignac.
No rationalist government can give back that crystallisation.
Nothing is so <i>anti-imagination</i> as the government
of the United States of America. We have noticed that
to their neighbours, the savages, crystallisation is almost
unknown. The Romans scarcely had an idea of it, and
discovered it only for physical love.
</p>
<p>
Hate has its crystallisation: as soon as it is possible to
hope for revenge, hate begins again.
</p>
<p>
If every creed, in which there is absurdity and inconsequence,
tends to place at the head of the party the people
who are most absurd, that is one more of the effects of
crystallisation. Even in mathematics (observe the
Newtonians in 1740) crystallisation goes on in the mind,
which cannot keep before it at every moment every
part of the demonstration of that which it believes.
</p>
<p>
In proof, see the destiny of the great German philosophers,
whose immortality, proclaimed so often, never
manages to last longer than thirty or forty years.
</p>
<p>
It is the impossibility of fathoming the "why?" of
our feelings, which makes the most reasonable man a
fanatic in music.
</p>
<p>
In face of certain contradictions it is not possible to be
convinced at will that we are right.

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span style="font-size: smaller;">DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE BIRTH OF LOVE IN
THE TWO SEXES</span></h3>
<p>
Women attach themselves by the favours they dispense.
As nineteen-twentieths of their ordinary
dreams are relative to love, after intimate intercourse
these day-dreams group themselves round a single object;
they have to justify a course so extraordinary, so decisive,
so contrary to all the habits of modesty. Men have no
such task; and, besides, the imagination of women has
time to work in detail upon the sweetness of such
moments.
</p>
<p>
As love casts doubts upon things the best proved, the
woman who, before she gave herself, was perfectly sure
that her lover was a man above the crowd, no sooner
thinks she has nothing left to refuse him, than she is all
fears lest he was only trying to put one more woman on
his list.
</p>
<p>
Then, and then only appears the second crystallisation,
which, being hand in hand with fear, is far the stronger.<a name="FNanchor_1_40" id="FNanchor_1_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_40" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>
<p>
Yesterday a queen, to-day she sees herself a slave. This
state of soul and mind is encouraged in a woman by the
nervous intoxication resulting from pleasures, which are
just so much keener as they are more rare. Besides, a
woman before her embroidery frame&mdash;insipid work
which only occupies the hand&mdash;is thinking about her
lover; while he is galloping with his squadron over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>plain, where leading one wrong movement would bring
him under arrest.
</p>
<p>
I should think, therefore, that the second crystallisation
must be far stronger in the case of women, because
theirs are more vivid fears; their vanity and honour are
compromised; distraction at least is more difficult.
</p>
<p>
A woman cannot be guided by the habit of being
reasonable, which I, Man, working at things cold and
reasonable for six hours every day, contract at my office perforce.
Even outside love, women are inclined to abandon
themselves to their imagination and habitual high spirits:
faults, therefore, in the object of their love ought more
rapidly to disappear.
</p>
<p>
Women prefer emotion to reason&mdash;that is plain: in
virtue of the futility of our customs, none of the affairs
of the family fall on their shoulders, so that reason is of
no use to them and they never find it of any practical
good.
</p>
<p>
On the contrary, to them it is always harmful; for the
only object of its appearance is to scold them for the
pleasures of yesterday, or forbid them others for tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
Give over to your wife the management of your dealings
with the bailiffs of two of your farms&mdash;I wager the
accounts will be kept better than by you, and then, sorry
tyrant, you will have the <i>right</i> at least to complain, since
to make yourself loved you do not possess the talent.
As soon as women enter on general reasonings, they are
unconsciously making love. But in matters of detail
they take pride in being stricter and more exact
than men. Half the small trading is put into the hands
of women, who acquit themselves of it better than their
husbands. It is a well-known maxim that, if you are
speaking business with a woman, you cannot be too serious.
</p>
<p>
This is because they are at all times and in all places
greedy of emotion.&mdash;Observe the pleasures of burial
rites in Scotland.

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<p class="quott">This was her favoured fairy realm, and here she erected her aerial
palaces.&mdash;<i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>, Chap. III.</p>

<p>
A girl of eighteen has not enough crystallisation
in her power, forms desires too limited by her
narrow experiences of the things of life, to be in a position
to love with as much passion as a woman of twenty-eight<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_4">(4)</a></span>.
</p>
<p>
This evening I was exposing this doctrine to a clever
woman, who maintains the contrary. "A girl's imagination
being chilled by no disagreeable experience, and the
prime of youth burning with all its force, any man can
be the motive upon which she creates a ravishing image.
Every time that she meets her lover, she will enjoy, not
what he is in reality, but that image of delight which she
has created for herself.
</p>
<p>
"Later, she is by this lover and by all men disillusioned,
experience of the dark reality has lessened in her
the power of crystallisation, mistrust has clipped the
wings of imagination. At the instance of no man on
earth, were he a very prodigy, could she form so irresistible
an image: she could love no more with the same
fire of her first youth. And as in love it is only the
illusion formed by ourselves which we enjoy, never can
the image, which she may create herself at twenty-eight,
have the brilliance and the loftiness on which first love
was built at sixteen: the second will always seem of a
degenerate species."
</p>
<p>
"No, madam. Evidently it is the presence of mistrust,
absent at sixteen, which must give to this second
love a different colour. In early youth love is like an
immense stream, which sweeps all before it in its course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>and we feel that we cannot resist it. Now at twenty-eight
a gentle heart knows itself: it knows that, if it is
still to find some happiness in life, from love it must be
claimed; and this poor, torn heart becomes the seat of
a fearful struggle between love and mistrust. Crystallisation
proceeds gradually; but the crystallisation, which
emerges triumphant from this terrible proof, in which
the soul in all its movements never loses sight of the
most awful danger, is a thousand times more brilliant and
more solid than crystallisation at sixteen, in which everything,
by right of age, is gaiety and happiness."

</p>
<p>
This conversation (Bologna, 9 March, 1820), bringing
into doubt a point which seemed to me so clear, makes
me believe more and more, that a man can say practically
nothing with any sense on that which happens in
the inmost heart of a woman of feeling: as to a coquet
it is different&mdash;<i>we</i> also have senses and vanity.
</p>
<p>
The disparity between the birth of love in the two
sexes would seem to come from the nature of their hopes,
which are different. One attacks, the other defends;
one asks, the other refuses; one is daring, the other timid.
</p>
<p>
The man reflects: "Can I please her? Will she love
me?"
</p>
<p>
The woman: "When he says he loves me, isn't it for
sport? Is his a solid character? Can he answer to himself
for the length of his attachments?" Thus it is that
many women regard and treat a young man of twenty-three
as a child. If he has gone through six campaigns,
he finds everything different&mdash;he is a young hero.
</p>
<p>
On the man's side, hope depends simply on the actions
of that which he loves&mdash;nothing easier to interpret. On
the side of woman, hope must rest on moral considerations&mdash;very
difficult rightly to appreciate.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Most men demand such a proof of love, as to their
mind dissipates all doubts; women are not so fortunate
as to be able to find such a proof. And there is in life
this trouble for lovers&mdash;that what makes the security and
happiness of one, makes the danger and almost the
humiliation of the other.
</p>
<p>
In love, men run the risk of the secret torture of the
soul&mdash;women expose themselves to the scoffs of the public;
they are more timid, and, besides, for them public opinion
means much more.&mdash;"Sois considérée, il le faut."<a name="FNanchor_2_42" id="FNanchor_2_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_42" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
</p>
<p>
They have not that sure means of ours of mastering
public opinion by risking for an instant their life.
</p>
<p>
Women, then, must naturally be far more mistrustful.
In virtue of their habits, all the mental movements,
which form periods in the birth of love, are in their case
more mild, more timid, more gradual and less decided.
There is therefore a greater disposition to constancy;
they will less easily withdraw from a crystallisation once
begun.
</p>
<p>
A woman, seeing her lover, reflects with rapidity, or
yields to the happiness of loving&mdash;happiness from which
she is recalled in a disagreeable manner, if he make the
least attack; for at the call to arms all pleasures must be
abandoned.
</p>
<p>
The lover's part is simpler&mdash;he looks in the eyes of the
woman he loves; a single smile can raise him to the
zenith of happiness, and he looks continually for it.<a name="FNanchor_3_43" id="FNanchor_3_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_43" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>The length of the siege humiliates a man; on the contrary
it makes a woman's glory.
</p>
<p>
A woman is capable of loving and, for an entire year,
not saying more than ten or twelve words to the man
whom she loves. At the bottom of her heart she keeps
note how often she has seen him&mdash;twice she went with
him to the theatre, twice she sat near him at dinner,
three times he bowed to her out walking.
</p>
<p>
One evening during some game he kissed her hand:
it is to be noticed that she allows no one since to kiss it
under any pretext, at the risk even of seeming peculiar.
</p>
<p>
In a man, Léonore<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_6" id="TNanch_6"></a><a href="#TN_6">(6)</a></span> remarked to me, such conduct
would be called a feminine way of love.

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<p>I make every possible effort to be dry. I would
impose silence upon my heart, which feels that it,
has much to say. When I think that I have noted a
truth, I always tremble lest I have written only a sigh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<p>In proof of crystallisation I shall content myself with
recalling the following anecdote. A young woman
hears that Edward, her relation, who is to return from
the Army, is a youth of great distinction; she is assured
that he loves her on her reputation; but he will want
probably to see her, before making a proposal and asking
her of her parents. She notices a young stranger at
church, she hears him called Edward, she thinks of nothing
but him&mdash;she is in love with him. Eight days later the
real Edward arrives; he is not the Edward of church.
She turns pale and will be unhappy for ever, if she is
forced to marry him.</p>

<p>That is what the poor of understanding call an example
of the senselessness of love.</p>

<p>A man of generosity lavishes the most delicate benefits
upon a girl in distress. No one could have more virtues,
and love was about to be born; but he wears a shabby
hat, and she notices that he is awkward in the saddle.
The girl confesses with a sigh that she cannot return the
warm feelings, which he evidently has for her.</p>

<p>A man pays his attentions to a lady of the greatest
respectability. She hears that this gentleman has had
physical troubles of a comical nature: she finds him
intolerable. And yet she had no intention of giving
herself to him, and these secret troubles in no way
blighted his understanding or amiability. It is simply
that crystallisation was made impossible.</p>

<p>In order that a human being may delight in deifying
an object to be loved, be it taken from the Ardennes
forest or picked up at a Bal de Coulon, that it seems to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>him perfect is the first necessity&mdash;perfect by no means
in every relation, but in every relation in which it is seen
at the time. Perfect in all respects it will seem only after
several days of the second crystallisation. The reason is
simple&mdash;then it is enough to have the idea of a perfection
in order to see it in the object of our love.</p>

<p>Beauty is only thus far necessary to the birth of love&mdash;ugliness
must not form an obstacle. The lover soon
comes to find his mistress beautiful, such as she is, without
thinking of ideal beauty.</p>

<p>The features which make up the ideally beautiful
would promise, if he could see them, a quantity of
happiness, if I may use the expression, which I would
express by the number one; whereas the features of his
mistress, such as they are, promise him one thousand
units of happiness.</p>

<p>Before the birth of love beauty is necessary as advertisement:
it predisposes us towards that passion by means
of the praises, which we hear given to the object of our
future love. Very eager admiration makes the smallest
hope decisive.</p>

<p>In gallant-love, and perhaps in passion-love during the
first five minutes, a woman, considering a possible lover,
gives more weight to the way in which he is seen by other
women, than to the way in which she sees him herself.</p>

<p>Hence the success of princes and officers.<a name="FNanchor_1_44" id="FNanchor_1_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_44" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The pretty
women of the Court of old king Lewis XIV were in love
with that sovereign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>Great care should be taken not to offer facilities to
hope, before it is certain that admiration is there. It
might give rise to dullness, which makes love for ever
impossible, and which, at any rate, is only to be cured
by the sting of wounded pride.</p>

<p>No one feels sympathy for the simpleton, nor for a
smile which is always there; hence the necessity in society
of a veneer of rakishness&mdash;that is, the privileged manner.
From too debased a plant we scorn to gather even a
smile. In love, our vanity disdains a victory which is too
easy; and in all matters man is not given to magnifying
the value of an offering.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_44" id="Footnote_1_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_44"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Those who remarked in the countenance of this young hero a
dissolute audacity mixed with extreme haughtiness and indifference
to the feelings of others, could not yet deny to his countenance that
sort of comeliness, which belongs to an open set of features well formed
by nature, modelled by art to the usual rules of courtesy, yet so far frank
and honest that they seemed as if they disclaimed to conceal the natural
working of the soul. Such an expression is often mistaken for manly
frankness, when in truth it arises from the reckless indifference of a libertine
disposition, conscious of superiority of birth and wealth, or of some
other adventitious advantage totally unconnected with personal merit.

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<p>Crystallisation having once begun, we enjoy
with delight each new beauty discovered in that
which we love.</p>

<p>But what is beauty? It is the appearance of an aptitude
for giving you pleasure.</p>

<p>The pleasures of all individuals are different and often
opposed to one another; which explains very well how
that, which is beauty for one individual, is ugliness for
another. (Conclusive example of Del Rosso and Lisio,
1st January, 1820.)</p>

<p>The right way to discover the nature of beauty is to
look for the nature of the pleasures of each individual.
Del Rosso, for example, needs a woman who allows a
certain boldness of movement, and who by her smiles
authorises considerable licence; a woman who at each
instant holds physical pleasures before his imagination,
and who excites in him the power of pleasing,
while giving him at the same time the means of displaying
it.</p>

<p>Apparently, by love Del Rosso understands physical
love, and Lisio passion-love. Obviously they are not
likely to agree about the word beauty.<a name="FNanchor_1_45" id="FNanchor_1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_45" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The beauty then, discovered by you, being the appearance
of an aptitude for giving you pleasure, and pleasure
being different from pleasure as man from man, the
crystallisation formed in the head of each individual
must bear the colour of that individual's pleasures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>A man's crystallisation of his mistress, or her <i>beauty</i>,
is no other thing than the collection of all the satisfactions
of all the desires, which he can have felt successively
at her instance.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">FURTHER CONSIDERATION OF CRYSTALLISATION</span></h3>


<p>Why do we enjoy with delight each new beauty,
discovered in that which we love?</p>

<p>It is because each new beauty gives the full and entire
satisfaction of a desire. You wish your mistress gentle&mdash;she
is gentle; and then you wish her proud like Emilie
in Corneille, and although these qualities are probably
incompatible, instantly she appears with the soul of a
Roman. That is the moral reason which makes love the
strongest of the passions. In all others, desires must
accommodate themselves to cold realities; here it is
realities which model themselves spontaneously upon
desires. Of all the passions, therefore, it is in love that
violent desires find the greatest satisfaction.</p>

<p>There are certain general conditions of happiness,
whose influence extends over every fulfilment of particular
desires:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. She seems to belong to you, for you only can make
her happy.</p>

<p>2. She is the judge of your worth. This condition
was very important at the gallant and chivalrous Courts
of Francis I and Henry II, and at the elegant Court of
Lewis XV. Under a constitutional and rationalist
government women lose this range of influence
entirely.</p>

<p>3. For a romantic heart&mdash;The loftier her soul, the more
sublime will be the pleasures that await her in your arms,
and the more purified of the dross of all vulgar considerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>The majority of young Frenchmen are, at eighteen,
disciples of Rousseau; for them this condition of happiness
is important.</p>

<p>In the midst of operations so apt to mislead our desire
of happiness, there is no keeping cool.</p>

<p>For, the moment he is in love, the steadiest man sees
no object such as it is. His own advantages he minimises,
and magnifies the smallest favours of the loved one.
Fears and hopes take at once a tinge of the romantic.
(Wayward.) He no longer attributes anything to chance;
he loses the perception of probability; in its effect upon
his happiness a thing imagined is a thing existent.<a name="FNanchor_1_46" id="FNanchor_1_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_46" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A terrible symptom that you are losing your head:&mdash;you
think of some little thing which is difficult to make
out; you see it white, and interpret that in favour of
your love; a moment later you notice that actually it
is black, and still you find it conclusively favourable to
your love.</p>

<p>Then indeed the soul, a prey to mortal uncertainties,
feels keenly the need of a friend. But there is no friend
for the lover. The Court knew that; and it is the
source of the only kind of indiscretion which a woman
of delicacy might forgive.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_46" id="Footnote_1_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_46"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> There is a physical cause&mdash;a mad impulse, a rush of blood to the
brain, a disorder in the nerves and in the cerebral centre. Observe the
transitory courage of stags and the spiritual state of a soprano. Physiology,
in 1922, will give us a description of the physical side of this phenomenon.
I recommend this to the attention of Dr. Edwards<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_8" id="TNanch_8"></a><a href="#TN_8">(8)</a></span>.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF THE FIRST STEP; OF THE FASHIONABLE
WORLD; OF MISFORTUNES</span></h3>


<p>That which is most surprising in the passion of love
is the first step&mdash;the extravagance of the change,
which comes over a man's brain.</p>

<p>The fashionable world, with its brilliant parties, is of
service to love in favouring this first step.</p>

<p>It begins by changing simple admiration (i) into tender
admiration (ii)&mdash;what pleasure to kiss her, etc.</p>

<p>In a <i>salon</i> lit by thousands of candles a fast valse throws
a fever upon young hearts, eclipses timidity, swells the
consciousness of power&mdash;in fact, gives them the daring
to love. For to see a lovable object is not enough: on
the contrary, the fact that it is extremely lovable discourages
a gentle soul&mdash;he must see it, if not in love
with him,<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> at least despoiled of its majesty.</p>

<p>Who takes it into his head to become the paramour of
a queen unless the advances are from her?<a name="FNanchor_2_48" id="FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_48" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Thus nothing is more favourable to the birth of love
than a life of irksome solitude, broken now and again by
a long-desired ball. This is the plan of wise mothers
who have daughters.</p>

<p>The real fashionable world, such as was found at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>Court of France,<a name="FNanchor_3_49" id="FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_49" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and which since 1780,<a name="FNanchor_4_50" id="FNanchor_4_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_50" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I think, exists
no more, was unfavourable to love, because it made the
solitude and the leisure, indispensable to the work of
crystallisation, almost impossible.</p>

<p>Court life gives the habit of observing and making a
great number of subtle distinctions, and the subtlest
distinction may be the beginning of an admiration and
of a passion.<a name="FNanchor_5_51" id="FNanchor_5_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_51" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>When the troubles of love are mixed with those of
another kind (the troubles of vanity&mdash;if your mistress
offend your proper pride, your sense of honour or personal
dignity&mdash;troubles of health, money and political
persecution, etc.), it is only in appearance that love is
increased by these annoyances. Occupying the imagination
otherwise, they prevent crystallisation in love still
hopeful, and in happy love the birth of little doubts.
When these misfortunes have departed, the sweetness
and the folly of love return.</p>

<p>Observe that misfortunes favour the birth of love in
light and unsensitive characters, and that, after it is
born, misfortunes, which existed before, are favourable to
it; in as much as the imagination, recoiling from the
gloomy impressions offered by all the other circumstances
of life, throws itself wholly into the work of crystallisation.</p>

the solitary, their soul is distracted, and part of their imagination is busy

which most readily seduces the truly feminine heart. Hence the success
of serious young officers. Women well know how to make the distinction
between force of character and the violence of those movements of
passion, the possibility of which they feel strongly in their own hearts.
The most distinguished women are sometimes duped by a little charlatanism
in this matter. It can be used without fear, as soon as crystallisation
is seen to have begun.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>


<p>The following point, which will be disputed, I offer
only to those&mdash;shall I say unhappy enough?&mdash;to
have loved with passion during long years, and loved in
the face of invincible obstacles:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sight of all that is extremely beautiful in nature
and in art recalls, with the swiftness of lightning, the
memory of that which we love. It is by the process of
the jewelled branch in the mines of Salzburg, that
everything in the world which is beautiful and lofty contributes
to the beauty of that which we love, and that
forthwith a sudden glimpse of delight fills the eyes with
tears. In this way, love and the love of beauty give life
mutually to one another.</p>

<p>One of life's miseries is that the happiness of seeing
and talking to the object of our love leaves no distinct
memories behind. The soul, it seems, is too troubled by
its emotions for that which causes or accompanies them
to impress it. The soul and its sensations are one and
the same. It is perhaps because these pleasures cannot
be used up by voluntary recollection, that they return
again and again with such force, as soon as ever some
object comes to drag us from day-dreams devoted to
the woman we love, and by some new connexion<a name="FNanchor_1_52" id="FNanchor_1_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_52" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to
bring her still more vividly to our memory.</p>

<p>A dry old architect used to meet her in society every
evening. Following a natural impulse, and without
paying attention to what I was saying to her,<a name="FNanchor_2_53" id="FNanchor_2_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_53" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> I one day
sang his praises in a sentimental and pompous strain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>which made her laugh at me. I had not the strength
to say to her: "He sees you every evening."</p>

<p>So powerful is this sensation that it extends even to
the person of my enemy, who is always at her side. When
I see her, she reminds me of Léonore so much, that at
the time I cannot hate her, however much I try.</p>

<p>It looks as if, by a curious whim of the heart, the charm,
which the woman we love can communicate, were greater
than that which she herself possesses. The vision of that
distant city, where we saw her a moment,<a name="FNanchor_3_54" id="FNanchor_3_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_54" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> throws us into
dreams sweeter and more profound than would her
very presence. It is the effect of harsh treatment.</p>

<p>The day-dreams of love cannot be scrutinised. I
have observed that I can re-read a good novel every three
years with the same pleasure. It gives me feelings akin
to the kind of emotional taste, which dominates me at
the moment, or if my feelings are nil, makes for variety
in my ideas. Also, I can listen with pleasure to the same
music, but, in this, memory must not intrude. The
imagination should be affected and nothing else; if, at
the twentieth representation, an opera gives more pleasure,
it is either because the music is better understood,
or because it also brings back the feeling it gave at the
first.</p>

<p>As to new lights, which a novel may throw upon our
knowledge of the human heart, I still remember clearly
the old ones, and am pleased even to find them noted in
the margin. But this kind of pleasure pertains to the
novels, in so far as they advance me in the knowledge
of man, and not in the least to day-dreaming&mdash;the
veritable pleasure of novels. Such day-dreaming is
inscrutable. To watch it is for the present to kill it, for
you fall into a philosophical analysis of pleasure; and it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>is killing it still more certainly for the future, for nothing
is surer to paralyse the imagination than the appeal to
memory<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_9" id="TNanch_9"></a><a href="#TN_9">(9)</a></span>. If I find in the margin a note, depicting
my feelings on reading <i>Old Mortality</i> three years ago in
Florence, I am plunged immediately into the history of
my life, into an estimate of the degree of happiness at
the two epochs, in short, into the deepest problems of
philosophy&mdash;and then good-bye for a long season to the
unchecked play of tender feelings.</p>

<p>Every great poet with a lively imagination is timid,
he is afraid of men, that is to say, for the interruptions
and troubles with which they can invade the delight of
his dreams. He fears for his concentration. Men come
along with their gross interests to drag him from the
gardens of Armida, and force him into a fetid slough:
only by irritating him can they fix his attention on themselves.
It is this habit of feeding his soul upon touching
dreams and this horror of the vulgar which draws a great
artist so near to love.</p>

<p>The more of the great artist a man has in him, the
more must he wish for titles and honours as a bulwark.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>


<p>Suddenly in the midst of the most violent and
the most thwarted passion come moments, when a
man believes that he is in love no longer&mdash;as it were a
spring of fresh water in the middle of the sea. To think
of his mistress is no longer very much pleasure, and,
although he is worn-out by the severity of her treatment,
the fact that everything in life has lost its interest is a
still greater misery. After a manner of existence which,
fitful though it was, gave to all nature a new aspect,
passionate and absorbing, now follows the dreariest and
most despondent void.</p>

<p>It may be that your last visit to the woman, whom you
love, left you in a situation, from which, once before,
your imagination had gathered the full harvest of sensation.
For example, after a period of coldness, she has
treated you less badly, letting you conceive exactly the
same degree of hope and by the same external signs as
on a previous occasion&mdash;all this perhaps unconsciously.
Imagination picks up memory and its sinister warnings
by the way, and instantly crystallisation<a name="FNanchor_1_55" id="FNanchor_1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_55" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ceases.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_55" id="Footnote_1_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_55"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> First, I am advised to cut out this word; next, if I fail in this for
want of literary power, to repeat again and again that I mean by crystallisation
a certain fever in the imagination, which transforms past recognition
what is, as often as not, a quite ordinary object, and makes of it a thing
apart. A man who looks to excite this fever in souls, which know no other
path but vanity to reach their happiness, must tie his necktie well and
constantly give his attention to a thousand details, which preclude all
possibility of unrestraint. Society women own to the effect, denying at
the same time or not seeing the cause.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<p class="quott">In a small port, the name of which I forget, near Perpignan, 25th
February, 1822.<a name="FNanchor_1_56" id="FNanchor_1_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_56" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
</p>

<p>This evening I have just found out that music,
when it is perfect, puts the heart into the same
state as it enjoys in the presence of the loved one&mdash;that
is to say, it gives seemingly the keenest happiness existing
on the face of the earth.</p>

<p>If this were so for all men, there would be no more
favourable incentive to love.</p>

<p>But I had already remarked at Naples last year that
perfect music, like perfect pantomime, makes me think
of that which is at the moment the object of my dreams,
and that the ideas, which it suggests to me, are excellent:
at Naples, it was on the means of arming the Greeks.</p>

<p>Now this evening I cannot deceive myself&mdash;I have the
misfortune <i>of being too great an admirer of milady
L</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_57" id="FNanchor_2_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_57" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>And perhaps the perfect music, which I have had the
luck to hear again, after two or three months of privation,
although going nightly to the Opera, has simply had
the effect, which I recognised long ago&mdash;I mean that of
producing lively thoughts on what is already in the
heart.</p>

<p>March 4th&mdash;eight days later.</p>

<p>I dare neither erase nor approve the preceding
observation. Certain it is that, as I wrote it, I read it
in my heart. If to-day I bring it into question, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>because I have lost the memory of what I saw at that
time.</p>

<p>The habit of hearing music and dreaming its dreams
disposes towards love. A sad and gentle air, provided it
is not too dramatic, so that the imagination is forced to
dwell on the action, is a direct stimulant to dreams of
love and a delight for gentle and unhappy souls: for
example, the drawn-out passage on the clarionet at the
beginning of the quartet in <i>Bianca and Faliero</i><span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_10" id="TNanch_10"></a><a href="#TN_10">(10)</a></span>,
and the recitative of La Camporesi towards the middle
of the quartet.</p>

<p>A lover at peace with his mistress enjoys to distraction
Rossini's famous duet in <i>Armida and Rinaldo</i>, depicting
so justly the little doubts of happy love and the moments
of delight which follow its reconciliations. It seems to
him that the instrumental part, which comes in the middle
of the duet, at the moment when Rinaldo wishes to fly,
and represents in such an amazing way the conflict of
the passions, has a physical influence upon his heart and
touches it in reality. On this subject I dare not say what
I feel; I should pass for a madman among people of the
north.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">BEAUTY DETHRONED BY LOVE</span></h3>


<p>Alberic meets in a box at the theatre a woman
more beautiful than his mistress (I beg to be
allowed here a mathematical valuation)&mdash;that is to say,
her features promise three units of happiness instead of
two, supposing the quantity of happiness given by perfect
beauty to be expressed by the number four.</p>

<p>Is it surprising that he prefers the features of his
mistress, which promise a hundred units of happiness
<i>for him</i>? Even the minor defects of her face, a small-pox
mark, for example, touches the heart of the man
who loves, and, when he observes them even in another
woman, sets him dreaming far away. What, then, when
he sees them in his mistress? Why, he has felt a thousand
sentiments in presence of that small-pox mark, sentiments
for the most part sweet, and all of the greatest
interest; and now, such as they are, they are evoked
afresh with incredible vividness by the sight of this
sign, even in the face of another woman.</p>

<p>If ugliness thus comes to be preferred and loved, it is
because in this case ugliness is beauty.<a name="FNanchor_1_58" id="FNanchor_1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_58" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> A man was
passionately in love with a woman, very thin and scarred
with small-pox: death bereft him of her. At Rome,
three years after, he makes friends with two women, one
more lovely than the day, the other thin, scarred with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>small-pox, and thereby, if you will, quite ugly. There
he is, at the end of a week, in love with the ugly one&mdash;and
this week he employs in effacing her ugliness with
his memories; and with a very pardonable coquetry
the lesser beauty did not fail to help him in the operation
with a slight whip-up of the pulse.<a name="FNanchor_2_59" id="FNanchor_2_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_59" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A man meets a
woman and is offended by her ugliness; soon, if she is
unpretentious, her expression makes him forget the defects
of her features; he finds her amiable&mdash;he conceives that
one could love her. A week later he has hopes; another
week and they are taken from him; another and he's
mad.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">LIMITATIONS OF BEAUTY</span></h3>


<p>An analogy is to be seen at the theatre in the
reception of the public's favourite actors: the
spectators are no longer conscious of the beauty or ugliness
which the actors have in reality. Lekain, for all his
remarkable ugliness, had a harvest of broken hearts&mdash;Garrick
also. There are several reasons for this; the
principal being that it was no longer the actual beauty
of their features or their ways which people saw, but
emphatically that which imagination was long since
used to lend them, as a return for, and in memory
of, all the pleasure they had given it. Why, take a
comedian&mdash;his face alone raises a laugh as he first
walks on.</p>

<p>A girl going for the first time to the Français would
perhaps feel some antipathy to Lekain during the first
scene; but soon he was making her weep or shiver&mdash;and
how resist him as Tancrède<a name="FNanchor_1_60" id="FNanchor_1_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_60" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or Orosmane?</p>

<p>If his ugliness were still a little visible to her eyes, the
fervour of an entire audience, and the nervous effect
produced upon a young heart,<a name="FNanchor_2_61" id="FNanchor_2_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_61" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> soon managed to eclipse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>it. If anything was still heard about his ugliness, it was
mere talk; but not a word of it&mdash;Lekain's lady enthusiasts
could be heard to exclaim "He's lovely!"</p>

<p>Remember that beauty is the expression of character,
or, put differently, of moral habits, and that consequently
it is exempt from all passion. Now it is passion that
we want. Beauty can only supply us with probabilities
about a woman, and probabilities, moreover, based on her
capacity for self-possession; while the glances of your
mistress with her small-pox scars are a delightful reality,
which destroys all the probabilities in the world.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_60" id="Footnote_1_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_60"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See Madame de Staël in <i>Delphine</i>, I think; there you have the
artifice of plain women.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_61" id="Footnote_2_61"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_61"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I should be inclined to attribute to this nervous sympathy the
prodigious and incomprehensible effect of fashionable music. (Sympathy
at Dresden for Rossini, 1821.) As soon as it is out of fashion, it becomes
no worse for that, and yet it ceases to have any effect upon perfectly
ingenuous girls. Perhaps it used to please them, as also stimulating
young men to fervour.
</p>
<p>
Madame de Sévigné says to her daughter (Letter 202, May 6, 1672):
"Lully surpassed himself in his royal music; that beautiful <i>Miserere</i>
was still further enlarged: there was a <i>Libera</i> at which all eyes were
full of tears."
</p>
<p>
It is as impossible to doubt the truth of this effect, as to refuse wit or
refinement to Madame de Sévigné. Lully's music, which charmed her,
would make us run away at present; in her day, his music encouraged
crystallisation&mdash;it makes it impossible in ours.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">LIMITATIONS OF BEAUTY&mdash;(<i>continued</i>)</span></h3>


<p>A woman of quick fancy and tender heart, but
timid and cautious in her sensibility, who the day
after she appears in society, passes in review a thousand
times nervously and painfully all that she may have said
or given hint of&mdash;such a woman, I say, grows easily used
to want of beauty in a man: it is hardly an obstacle in
rousing her affection.</p>

<p>It is really on the same principle that you care next
to nothing for the degree of beauty in a mistress, whom
you adore and who repays you with harshness. You have
very nearly stopped crystallising her beauty, and when
your <i>friend in need</i> tells you that she isn't pretty, you
are almost ready to agree. Then he thinks he has made
great way.</p>

<p>My friend, brave Captain Trab, described to me this
evening his feelings on seeing Mirabeau once upon a
time. No one looking upon that great man felt a disagreeable
sensation in the eyes&mdash;that is to say, found him
ugly. People were carried away by his thundering words;
they fixed their attention, they delighted in fixing their
attention, only on what was beautiful in his face. As
he had practically no beautiful features (in the sense of
sculpturesque or picturesque beauty) they minded only
what beauty he had of another kind, the beauty of expression.<a name="FNanchor_1_62" id="FNanchor_1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_62" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>While attention was blind to all traces of ugliness,
picturesquely speaking, it fastened on the smallest passable
details with fervour&mdash;for example, the beauty of his
vast head of hair. If he had had horns, people would
have thought them lovely.<a name="FNanchor_2_63" id="FNanchor_2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_63" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>The appearance every evening of a pretty dancer
forces a little interest from those poor souls, blasé or
bereft of imagination, who adorn the balcony of the
opera. By her graceful movements, daring and strange,
she awakens their physical love and procures them perhaps
the only crystallisation of which they are still capable.
This is the way by which a young scarecrow, who in the
street would not have been honoured with a glance, least
of all from people the worse for wear, has only to appear
frequently on the stage, and she manages to get herself
handsomely supported. Geoffroy used to say that the
theatre is the pedestal of woman. The more notorious
and the more dilapidated a dancer, the more she is
worth; hence the green-room proverb: "Some get
sold at a price who wouldn't be taken as a gift." These
women steal part of their passions from their lovers,
and are very susceptible of love from pique.</p>

<p>How manage not to connect generous or lovable sentiments
with the face of an actress, in whose features there
is nothing repugnant, whom for two hours every evening
we see expressing the most noble feelings, and whom
otherwise we do not know? When at last you succeed
in being received by her, her features recall such pleasing
feelings, that the entire reality which surrounds her,
however little nobility it may sometimes possess, is
instantly invested with romantic and touching colours.</p>

<p>"Devotee, in the days of my youth, of that boring
French tragedy,<a name="FNanchor_3_64" id="FNanchor_3_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_64" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whenever I had the luck of supping
with Mlle. Olivier, I found myself every other moment
overbrimming with respect, in the belief that I was
speaking to a queen; and really I have never been quite
sure whether, in her case, I had fallen in love with a
queen or a pretty tart."</p>


<div class="footnotes">

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_62" id="Footnote_1_62"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_62"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> That is the advantage of being <i>à la mode</i>. Putting aside the defects
of a face which are already familiar, and no longer have any effect upon
the imagination, the public take hold of one of the three following ideas
of beauty:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1) The people&mdash;of the idea of wealth.
</p>
<p>
(2) The upper classes&mdash;of the idea of elegance, material or moral.
</p>
<p>
(3) The Court&mdash;of the idea: "My object is to please the women."
</p>
<p>
Almost all take hold of a mixture of all three. The happiness attached
to the idea of riches is linked to a refinement in the pleasure which the
idea of elegance suggests, and the whole comes into touch with love.
In one way or another the imagination is led on by novelty. It is possible
in this way to be interested in a very ugly man without thinking of his
ugliness,<sup>[*]</sup> and in good time his ugliness becomes beauty. At Vienna, in
1788, Madame Viganò, a dancer and <i>the</i> woman of the moment, was
with child&mdash;very soon the ladies took to wearing little <i>Ventres à la Viganò</i>.
For the same reason reversed, nothing more fearful than a fashion out
of date! Bad taste is a confusion of fashion, which lives only by change,
with the lasting beauty produced by such and such a government, guided
by such and such a climate. A building in fashion to-day, in ten years
will be out of fashion. It will be less displeasing in two hundred years,
when its fashionable day will be forgotten. Lovers are quite mad to
think about their dress; a woman has other things to do, when
seeing the object of her love, than to bother about his get-up; we look
at our lover, we do not examine him, says Rousseau. If this examination
takes place, we are dealing with gallant-love and not passion-love. The
brilliance of beauty is almost offensive in the object of our love; it is
none of our business to see her beautiful, we want her tender and languishing.
Adornment has effect in love only upon girls, who are so rigidly
guarded in their parents' house, that they often lose their hearts through
their eyes. (L.'s words. September 15, 1820.)

combination of sentiments (see above, the small-pox scars) a woman in
love grows used to the faults of her lover. The Russian Princess C. has
actually become used to a man who literally has no nose. The picture
of his courage, of his pistol loaded to kill himself in despair at his misfortune,
and pity for the bitter calamity, enhanced by the idea that he
will recover and is beginning to recover, are the forces which have worked
this miracle. The poor fellow with his wound must appear not to think
of his misfortune. (Berlin, 1807.)</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XX</h3>


<p>Perhaps men who are not susceptible to the feelings
of passion-love are those most keenly sensitive to
the effects of beauty: that at least is the strongest impression
which such men can receive of women.</p>

<p>He who has felt his heart beating at a distant glimpse
of the white satin hat of the woman he loves, is quite
amazed by the chill left upon him by the approach of
the greatest beauty in the world. He may even have a
qualm of distress, to observe the excitement of others.</p>

<p>Extremely lovely women cause less surprise the second
day. 'Tis a great misfortune, it discourages crystallisation.
Their merit being obvious to all and public
property, they are bound to reckon more fools in the
list of their lovers than princes, millionaires, etc.<a name="FNanchor_1_65" id="FNanchor_1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_65" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT</span></h3>

<p>Imaginative souls are sensitive and also mistrustful,
even the most ingenuous,<a name="FNanchor_1_66" id="FNanchor_1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_66" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;I maintain.
They may be suspicious without knowing it: they have
had so many disappointments in life. Thus everything
set-out and official, when a man is first introduced, scares
the imagination and drives away the possibility of crystallisation;
the romantic is then, on the contrary, love's
triumph.</p>

<p>Nothing simpler&mdash;for in the supreme astonishment,
which keeps the thoughts busy for long upon something
out of the ordinary, is already half the mental exercise
necessary to crystallisation.</p>

<p>I will quote the beginning of the Amours of Séraphine
(<i>Gil Blas</i>, Bk. IV, Chap. X). It is Don Fernando who
tells the story of his flight, when pursued by the agents
of the inquisition....</p>

<blockquote>

<p>After crossing several walks I came to a drawing-room, the
door of which was also left open. I entered, and when I had
observed all its magnificence.... One side of the room a door
stood ajar; I partly opened it and saw a suite of apartments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>whereof only the furthest was lighted. "What is to be done
now?" I asked myself.... I could not resist my curiosity....
Advancing boldly, I went through all the rooms and reached one
where there was a light&mdash;to wit, a taper upon a marble table in a
silver-gilt candlestick.... But soon afterwards, casting my eyes
upon a bed, the curtains of which were partly drawn on account
of the heat, I perceived an object which at once engrossed my
attention: a young lady, fast asleep in spite of the noise of the
thunder, which had just been bursting forth. I softly drew near
her. My mind was suddenly troubled at the sight. Whilst I
feasted my eyes with the pleasure of beholding her, she awoke.</p>

<p>Imagine her surprise at seeing in her room at midnight a man
who was an utter stranger to her! She trembled on beholding
me and shrieked aloud.... I took pains to reassure her and
throwing myself on my knees before her, said&mdash;"Madam, have
no fear." She called her women.... Grown a little braver by
his (an old servant's) presence, she haughtily asked me who
was, etc. etc."<a name="FNanchor_2_67" id="FNanchor_2_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_67" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>There is an introduction not easily to be forgotten!
On the other hand, could there be anything sillier in our
customs of to-day than the official, and at the same time
almost sentimental, introduction of the young wooer to
his future wife: such legal prostitution goes so far as to
be almost offensive to modesty.</p>

<p>"I have just been present this afternoon, February
17th, 1790," says Chamfort, "at a so-called family
function. That is to say, men of respectable reputation
and a decent company were congratulating on her
good fortune Mlle. de Marille, a young person of
beauty, wit and virtue, who is to be favoured with becoming
the wife of M. R.&mdash;an unhealthy dotard, repulsive,
dishonest, and mad, but rich: she has seen him for the
third time to-day, when signing the contract. If anything
characterises an age of infamy, it is the jubilation on
an occasion like this, it is the folly of such joy and&mdash;looking
ahead&mdash;the sanctimonious cruelty, with which the
same society will heap contempt without reserve upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>the pettiest imprudence of a poor young woman in
love."</p>

<p>Ceremony of all kinds, being in its essence something
affected and set-out beforehand, in which the point is to
act "properly," paralyses the imagination and leaves it
awake only to that which is opposed to the object of the
ceremony, e. g. something comical&mdash;whence the magic
effect of the slightest joke. A poor girl, struggling against
nervousness and attacks of modesty during the official
introduction of her <i>fiancé</i>, can think of nothing but
the part she is playing, and this again is a certain means
of stifling the imagination.</p>

<p>Modesty has far more to say against getting into bed
with a man whom you have seen but twice, after
three Latin words have been spoken in church, than
against giving way despite yourself to the man whom for
two years you have adored. But I am talking double
Dutch.</p>

<p>The fruitful source of the vices and mishaps, which
follow our marriages nowadays, is the Church of Rome.
It makes liberty for girls impossible before marriage, and
divorce impossible, when once they have made their mistake,
or rather when they find out the mistake of the choice
forced on them. Compare Germany, the land of happy
marriages: a delightful princess (Madame la Duchesse
de Sa&mdash;&mdash;) has just married in all good faith for the
fourth time, and has not failed to ask to the wedding
her three first husbands, with whom she is on the best
terms. That is going too far; but a single divorce, which
punishes a husband for his tyranny, prevents a thousand
cases of unhappy wedded life. What is amusing is that
Rome is one of the places where you see most divorces.</p>

<p>Love goes out at first sight towards a face, which reveals
in a man at once something to respect and something to
pity.</p>

A man who has lived finds in his memory numberless examples of
"affairs," and his only trouble is to make his choice. But if he wishes to
write, he no longer knows where to look for support. The anecdotes of
the particular circles he has lived in are unknown to the public, and it
would require an immense number of pages to recount them with the
necessary circumstantiality. I quote for that reason from generally-known
novels, but the ideas which I submit to the reader I do not ground
upon such empty fictions, calculated for the most part with an eye to
the picturesque rather than the true effect.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF INFATUATION</span></h3>


<p>The most fastidious spirits are very given to curiosity
and prepossession: this is to be seen, especially, in
beings in which that sacred fire, the source of the passions,
is extinct&mdash;in fact it is one of the most fatal symptoms.
There is also the infatuation of schoolboys just admitted
to society. At the two poles of life, with too much or
too little sensibility, there is little chance of simple
people getting the right effect from things, or feeling the
genuine sensation which they ought to give. These
beings, either too ardent or excessive in their ardour,
amorous on credit, if one may use the expression, throw
themselves at objects instead of awaiting them.</p>

<p>From afar off and without looking they enfold things
in that imaginary charm, of which they find a perennial
source within themselves, long before sensation, which
is the consequence of the object's nature, has had time
to reach them. Then, on coming to close quarters, they
see these things not such as they are, but as they have
made them; they think they are enjoying such and
such an object, while, under cover of that object, they are
enjoying themselves. But one fine day a man gets tired
of keeping the whole thing going; he discovers that his
idol is <i>not playing the game</i>; infatuation collapses and
the resulting shock to his self-esteem makes him unfair
to that which he appreciated too highly.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">THE THUNDERBOLT FROM THE BLUE<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_11" id="TNanch_11"></a><a href="#TN_11">(11)</a></span></span></h3>


<p>So ridiculous an expression ought to be changed, yet
the thing exists. I have seen the amiable and noble
Wilhelmina, the despair of the beaux of Berlin, making
light of love and laughing at its folly. In the brilliance of
youth, wit, beauty and all kinds of good luck&mdash;a boundless
fortune, giving her the opportunity of developing all her
qualities, seemed to conspire with nature to give the world
an example, rarely seen, of perfect happiness bestowed
upon an object perfectly worthy. She was twenty-three
years old and, already some time at Court, had won the
homage of the bluest blood. Her virtue, unpretentious
but invulnerable, was quoted as a pattern. Henceforth
the most charming men, despairing of their powers of
fascination, aspired only to make her their friend. One
evening she goes to a ball at Prince Ferdinand's: she
dances for ten minutes with a young Captain.</p>

<p>"From that moment," she writes subsequently to a
friend,<a name="FNanchor_1_68" id="FNanchor_1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_68" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> "he was master of my heart and of me, and this
to a degree that would have filled me with terror, if the
happiness of seeing Herman had left me time to think of
the rest of existence. My only thought was to observe
whether he gave me a little notice.</p>

<p>"To-day the only consolation that I might find for
my fault is to nurse the illusion within me, that it is
through a superior power that I am lost to reason and to
myself. I have no word to describe, in a way that comes
at all near the reality, the degree of disorder and turmoil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>to which the mere sight of him could bring my whole
being. I blush to think of the rapidity and the violence
with which I was drawn towards him. If his first word,
when at last he spoke to me, had been 'Do you adore
me?'&mdash;truly I should not have had the power to have
answered anything but 'yes.' I was far from thinking
that the effect of a feeling could be at once so sudden
and so unforeseen. In fact, for an instant, I believed
that I had been poisoned.</p>

<p>"Unhappily you and the world, my dear friend, know
how well I have loved Herman. Well, after quarter of an
hour he was so dear to me that he cannot have become
dearer since. I saw then all his faults and I forgave them
all, provided only he would love me.</p>

<p>"Soon after I had danced with him, the king left:
Herman, who belonged to the suite, had to follow him.
With him, everything in nature disappeared. It is no
good to try to depict the excess of weariness with which
I felt weighed down, as soon as he was out of my sight.
It was equal only to the keenness of my desire to be
alone with myself.</p>

<p>"At last I got away. No sooner the door of my room
shut and bolted than I wanted to resist my passion. I
thought I should succeed. Ah, dear friend, believe me
I paid dear that evening and the following days for the
pleasure of being able to credit myself with some virtue."</p>

<p>The preceding lines are the exact story of an event
which was the topic of the day; for after a month or
two poor Wilhelmina was unfortunate enough for people
to take notice of her feelings. Such was the origin of
that long series of troubles by which she perished so
young and so tragically&mdash;poisoned by herself or her
lover. All that we could see in this young Captain was
that he was an excellent dancer; he had plenty of gaiety
and still more assurance, a general air of good nature and
spent his time with prostitutes; for the rest, scarcely a
nobleman, quite poor and not seen at Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>In these cases it is not enough to have no misgivings&mdash;one
must be sick of misgivings&mdash;have, so to speak, the
impatience of courage to face life's chances.</p>

<p>The soul of a woman, grown tired, without noticing
it, of living without loving, convinced in spite of herself
by the example of other women&mdash;all the fears of life
surmounted and the sorry happiness of pride found
wanting&mdash;ends in creating unconsciously a model, an
ideal. One day she meets this model: crystallisation
recognises its object by the commotion it inspires and
consecrates for ever to the master of its fortunes the fruit
of all its previous dreams.<a name="FNanchor_2_69" id="FNanchor_2_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_69" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Women, whose hearts are open to this misfortune, have
too much grandeur of soul to love otherwise than with
passion. They would be saved if they could stoop to
gallantry.</p>

<p>As "thunderbolts" come from a secret lassitude in
what the catechism calls Virtue, and from boredom
brought on by the uniformity of perfection, I should be
inclined to think that it would generally be the privilege
of what is known in the world as "a bad lot" to bring
them down. I doubt very much whether rigidity <i>à la</i>
Cato has ever been the occasion of a "thunderbolt."</p>

<p>What makes them so rare is that if the heart, thus disposed
to love beforehand, has the slightest inkling of its
situation, there is no thunderbolt.</p>

<p>The soul of a woman, whom troubles have made mistrustful,
is not susceptible of this revolution.</p>

<p>Nothing facilitates "a thunderbolt" like praise, given
in advance and by women, to the person who is to occasion
it.</p>

<p>False "thunderbolts" form one of the most comic
sources of love stories. A weary woman, but one without
much feeling, thinks for a whole evening that she is in
love for life. She is proud of having found at last one
of those great commotions of the soul, which used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>allure her imagination. The next day she no longer knows
where to hide her face and, still more, how to avoid the
wretched object she was adoring the night before.</p>

<p>Clever people know how to spot, that is to say, make
capital out of these "thunderbolts."</p>

<p>Physical love also has its "thunderbolts." Yesterday
in her carriage with the prettiest and most easy-going
woman in Berlin, we saw her suddenly blush. She
became deeply absorbed and preoccupied. Handsome
Lieutenant Findorff had just passed. In the evening at
the play, according to her own confession to me, she was
out of her mind, she was beside herself, she could think
of nothing but Findorff, to whom she had never spoken.
If she had dared, she told me, she would have sent for
him&mdash;that pretty face bore all the signs of the most
violent passion. The next day it was still going on.
After three days, Findorff having played the blockhead,
she thought no more about it. A month later she loathed
him.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">VOYAGE IN AN UNKNOWN LAND</span></h3>


<p>I advise the majority of people born in the North
to skip the present chapter. It is an obscure dissertation
upon certain phenomena relative to the orange-tree,
a plant which does not grow or reach its full height
except in Italy and Spain. In order to be intelligible
elsewhere, I should have had to cut down the facts.</p>

<p>I should have had no hesitation about this, if for a
single moment I had intended to write a book to be
generally appreciated. But Heaven having refused me
the writer's gift, I have thought solely of describing with
all the ill-grace of science, but also with all its exactitude,
certain facts, of which I became involuntarily the witness
through a prolonged sojourn in the land of the orange-tree.
Frederick the Great, or some such other distinguished
man from the North, who never had the
opportunity of seeing the orange-tree growing in the
open, would doubtless have denied the facts which
follow&mdash;and denied in good faith. I have an infinite
respect for such good faith and can see its <i>wherefore</i>.</p>

<p>As this sincere declaration may seem presumption, I
append the following reflexion:&mdash;</p>

<p>We write haphazard, each one of us what we think
true, and each gives the lie to his neighbour. I see in
our books so many tickets in a lottery and in reality
they have no more value. Posterity, forgetting some and
reprinting others, declares the lucky numbers. And in
so far, each one of us having written as best he can, what
he thinks true, has no right to laugh at his neighbour&mdash;except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>where the satire is amusing. In that case he is
always right, especially if he writes like M. Courrier to
Del Furia<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_12" id="TNanch_12"></a><a href="#TN_12">(12)</a></span>.</p>

<p>After this preamble, I am going bravely to enter into
the examination of facts which, I am convinced, have
rarely been observed at Paris. But after all at Paris,
superior as of course it is to all other towns, orange-trees
are not seen growing out in the open, as at Sorrento,
and it is there that Lisio Visconti observed and noted
the following facts&mdash;at Sorrento, the country of Tasso,
on the Bay of Naples in a position half-way down to the
sea, still more picturesque than that of Naples itself, but
where no one reads the <i>Miroir</i>.</p>

<p>When we are to see in the evening the woman we love,
the suspense, the expectation of so great a happiness makes
every moment, which separates us from it, unbearable.</p>

<p>A devouring fever makes us take up and lay aside twenty
different occupations. We look every moment at our
watch&mdash;overjoyed when we see that we have managed to
pass ten minutes without looking at the time. The hour
so longed-for strikes at last, and when we are at her door
ready to knock&mdash;we would be glad not to find her in. It
is only on reflexion that we would be sorry for it. In a
word, the suspense before seeing her produces an unpleasant
effect.</p>

<p>There you have one of the things which make good
folk say that love drives men silly.</p>

<p>The reason is that the imagination, violently withdrawn
from dreams of delight in which every step
forward brings happiness, is brought back face to face
with severe reality.</p>

<p>The gentle soul knows well that in the combat which
is to begin the moment he sees her, the least inadvertency,
the least lack of attention or of courage will be paid for
by a defeat, poisoning, for a long time to come, the
dreams of fancy and of passion, and humiliating to a
man's pride, if he try to find consolation outside the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>sphere of passion. He says to himself: "I hadn't the
wit, I hadn't the pluck"; but the only way to have
pluck before the loved one is by loving her a little less.</p>

<p>It is a fragment of attention, torn by force with so much
trouble from the dreams of crystallisation, which allows
the crowd of things to escape us during our first words
with the woman we love&mdash;things which have no sense or
which have a sense contrary to what we mean&mdash;or else,
what is still more heartrending, we exaggerate our feelings
and they become ridiculous in our own eyes. We feel
vaguely that we are not paying enough attention to our
words and mechanically set about polishing and loading
our oratory. And, also, it is impossible to hold one's
tongue&mdash;silence would be embarrassing and make it
still less possible to give one's thoughts to her. So we
say in a feeling way a host of things that we do not feel,
and would be quite embarrassed to repeat, obstinately
keeping our distance from the woman before us, in order
more really to be with her. In the early hours of my
acquaintance with love, this oddity which I felt within
me, made me believe that I did not love.</p>

<p>I understand cowardice and how recruits, to be delivered
of their fear, throw themselves recklessly into the
midst of the fire. The number of silly things I have said
in the last two years, in order not to hold my tongue,
makes me mad when I think of them.</p>

<p>And that is what should easily mark in a woman's eyes
the difference between passion-love and gallantry, between
the gentle soul and the prosaic.<a name="FNanchor_1_70" id="FNanchor_1_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_70" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In these decisive moments the one gains as much as the
other loses: the prosaic soul gets just the degree of warmth
which he ordinarily wants, while excess of feeling drives
mad the poor gentle heart, who, to crown his troubles,
really means to hide his madness. Completely taken up
with keeping his own transports in check, he is miles away
from the self-possession necessary in order to seize opportunities,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>and leaves in a muddle after a visit, in which
the prosaic soul would have made a great step forward.
Directly it is a question of advancing his too violent
passion, a gentle being with pride cannot be eloquent
under the eye of the woman whom he loves: the pain
of ill-success is too much for him. The vulgar being, on
the contrary, calculates nicely the chances of success: he
is stopped by no foretastes of the suffering of defeat, and,
proud of that which makes him vulgar, laughs at the gentle
soul, who, with all the cleverness he may have, is never
quite enough at ease to say the simplest things and those
most certain to succeed. The gentle soul, far from being
able to grasp anything by force, must resign himself to obtaining
nothing except through the <i>charity</i> of her whom
he loves. If the woman one loves really has feelings, one
always has reason to regret having wished to put pressure
on oneself in order to make love to her. One looks shame-faced,
looks chilly, would look deceitful, did not passion
betray itself by other and surer signs. To express what we
feel so keenly, and in such detail, at every moment of the
day, is a task we take upon our shoulders because we have
read novels; for if we were natural, we would never
undertake anything so irksome. Instead of wanting to
speak of what we felt a quarter of an hour ago, and of
trying to make of it a general and interesting topic, we
would express simply the passing fragment of our feelings
at the moment. But no! we put the most violent pressure
upon ourselves for a worthless success, and, as there
is no evidence of actual sensation to back our words, and
as our memory cannot be working freely, we approve at
the time of things to say&mdash;and say them&mdash;comical to a
degree that is more than humiliating.</p>

<p>When at last, after an hour's trouble, this extremely
painful effort has resulted in getting away from the
enchanted gardens of the imagination, in order to enjoy
quite simply the presence of what you love, it often
happens&mdash;that you've got to take your leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>All this looks like extravagance, but I have seen better
still. A woman, whom one of my friends loved to
idolatry, pretending to take offence at some or other
want of delicacy, which I was never allowed to learn,
condemned him all of a sudden to see her only twice
a month. These visits, so rare and so intensely desired,
meant an attack of madness, and it wanted all Salviati's
strength of character to keep it from being seen by
outward signs.</p>

<p>From the very first, the idea of the visit's end is too
insistent for one to be able to take pleasure in the visit.
One speaks a great deal, deaf to one's own thoughts,
saying often the contrary of what one thinks. One
embarks upon discourses which have got suddenly to be
cut short, because of their absurdity&mdash;if one manage to
rouse oneself and listen to one's thoughts within. The
effort we make is so violent that we seem chilly. Love
hides itself in its excess.</p>

<p>Away from her, the imagination was lulled by the most
charming dialogues: there were transports the most
tender and the most touching. And thus for ten days or
so you think you have the courage to speak; but two
days before what should have been our day of happiness,
the fever begins, and, as the terrible instant draws near,
its force redoubles.</p>

<p>Just as you come into her <i>salon</i>, in order not to do or
say some incredible piece of nonsense, you clutch in
despair at the resolution of keeping your mouth shut and
your eyes on her&mdash;in order at least to be able to remember
her face. Scarcely before her, something like a kind
of drunkenness comes over your eyes; you feel driven
like a maniac to do strange actions; it is as if you had
two souls&mdash;one to act and the other to blame your actions.
You feel, in a confused way, that to turn your strained
attention to folly would temporarily refresh the blood,
and make you lose from sight the end of the visit and the
misery of parting for a fortnight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>If some bore be there, who tells a pointless story, the
poor lover, in his inexplicable madness, as if he were
nervous of losing moments so rare, becomes all attention.
That hour, of which he drew himself so sweet a picture,
passes like a flash of lightning and yet he feels, with
unspeakable bitterness, all the little circumstances which
show how much a stranger he has become to her whom he
loves. There he is in the midst of indifferent visitors
and sees himself the only one who does not know her life
of these past days, in all its details. At last he goes: and
as he coldly says good-bye, he has the agonising feeling of
two whole weeks before another meeting. Without a
doubt he would suffer less never to see the object of his
love again. It is in the style, only far blacker, of the Duc
de Policastro, who every six months travelled a hundred
leagues to see for a quarter of an hour at Lecce a beloved
mistress guarded by a jealous husband.</p>

<p>Here you can see clearly Will without influence upon
Love.</p>

<p>Out of all patience with one's mistress and oneself, how
furious the desire to bury oneself in indifference! The
only good of such visits is to replenish the treasure of
crystallisation.</p>

<p>Life for Salviati was divided into periods of two weeks,
which took their colour from the last evening he had
been allowed to see Madame &mdash;&mdash;. For example, he was
in the seventh heaven of delight the 21st of May, and
the 2nd of June he kept away from home, for fear of
yielding to the temptation of blowing out his brains.</p>

<p>I saw that evening how badly novelists have drawn
the moment of suicide. Salviati simply said to me:
"I'm thirsty, I must take this glass of water." I did not
oppose his resolution, but said good-bye: then he broke
down.</p>

<p>Seeing the obscurity which envelops the discourse of
lovers, it would not be prudent to push too far conclusions
drawn from an isolated detail of their conversation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>They give a fair glimpse of their feelings only in
sudden expressions&mdash;then it is the cry of the heart. Otherwise
it is from the complexion of the bulk of what is said
that inductions are to be drawn. And we must remember
that quite often a man, who is very moved, has no time
to notice the emotion of the person who is the cause of
his own.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">THE INTRODUCTION</span></h3>

<p>To see the subtlety and sureness of judgment with
which women grasp certain details, I am lost in
admiration: but a moment later, I see them praise a
blockhead to the skies, let themselves be moved to tears
by a piece of insipidity, or weigh gravely a fatuous
affectation, as if it were a telling characteristic. I cannot
conceive such simplicity. There must be some general
law in all this, unknown to me.</p>

<p>Attentive to one merit in a man and absorbed by one
detail, women feel it deeply and have no eyes for the
rest. All the nervous fluid is used up in the enjoyment
of this quality: there is none left to see the others.</p>

<p>I have seen the most remarkable men introduced to
very clever women; it was always a particle of bias
which decided the effect of the first inspection.</p>

<p>If I may be allowed a familiar detail, I shall tell the
story how charming Colonel L. B&mdash;&mdash; was to be introduced
to Madame de Struve of Koenigsberg&mdash;she a most distinguished
woman. "<i>Farà colpo?</i>"<a name="FNanchor_1_71" id="FNanchor_1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_71" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;we asked each
other; and a wager was made as a result. I go up to
Madame de Struve, and tell her the Colonel wears his
ties two days running&mdash;the second he turns them&mdash;she
could notice on his tie the creases downwards. Nothing
more palpably untrue!</p>

<p>As I finish, the dear fellow is announced. The silliest
little Parisian would have made more effect. Observe
that Madame de Struve was one who could love. She is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>also a respectable woman and there could have been no
question of gallantry between them.</p>

<p>Never were two characters more made for each other.
People blamed Madame de Struve for being romantic,
and there was nothing could touch L. B. but virtue carried
to the point of the romantic. Thanks to her, he had a
bullet put through him quite young.</p>

<p>It has been given to women admirably to feel the fine
shades of affection, the most imperceptible variations of
the human heart, the lightest movements of susceptibility.</p>

<p>In this regard they have an organ which in us is missing:
watch them nurse the wounded.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, they are equally unable to see what
mind consists in&mdash;as a moral composition. I have seen
the most distinguished women charmed with a clever
man, who was not myself, and, at the same time and
almost with the same word, admire the biggest fools.
I felt caught like a connoisseur, who sees the loveliest
diamonds taken for paste, and paste preferred for being
more massive.</p>

<p>And so I concluded that with women you have to
risk everything. Where General Lassale came to grief, a
captain with moustaches and heavy oaths succeeded.<a name="FNanchor_2_72" id="FNanchor_2_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_72" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
There is surely a whole side in men's merit which escapes
them. For myself, I always come back to physical laws.
The nervous fluid spends itself in men through the brain
and in women through the heart: that is why they are
more sensitive. Some great and obligatory work, within
the profession we have followed all our life, is our
consolation, but for them nothing can console but
distraction.</p>

<p>Appiani, who only believes in virtue as a last resort,
and with whom this evening I went routing out ideas
(exposing meanwhile those of this chapter) answered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The force of soul, which Eponina used with heroic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>devotion, to keep alive her husband in a cavern underground
and to keep him from sinking into despair, would
have helped her to hide from him a lover, if they had
lived at Rome in peace. Strong souls must have their
nourishment."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF MODESTY</span></h3>


<p>In Madagascar, a woman exposes without a thought
what is here most carefully hidden, but would die
of shame sooner than show her arm. Clearly three-quarters
of modesty come from example. It is perhaps
the one law, daughter of civilisation, which produces
only happiness.</p>

<p>People have noticed that birds of prey hide themselves
to drink; the reason being that, obliged to plunge their
head in the water, they are at that moment defenceless.
After a consideration of what happens at Tahiti,<a name="FNanchor_1_73" id="FNanchor_1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_73" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> I see
no other natural basis for modesty.</p>

<p>Love is the miracle of civilisation. There is nothing
but a physical love of the coarsest kind among savage or
too barbarian peoples.</p>

<p>And modesty gives love the help of imagination&mdash;that
is, gives it life.</p>

<p>Modesty is taught little girls very early by their
mothers with such jealous care, that it almost looks like
fellow-feeling; in this way women take measures in good
time for the happiness of the lover to come.</p>

<p>There can be nothing worse for a timid, sensitive
woman than the torture of having, in the presence of a
man, allowed herself something for which she thinks she
ought to blush; I am convinced that a woman with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>little pride would sooner face a thousand deaths. A
slight liberty, which touches a soft corner in the lover's
heart, gives her a moment of lively pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_2_74" id="FNanchor_2_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_74" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> If
he seem to blame it, or simply not to enjoy it to the
utmost, it must leave in the soul an agonising doubt.
And so a woman above the common sort has everything
to gain by being very reserved in her manner.
The game is not fair: against the chance of a little
pleasure or the advantage of seeming a little more lovable,
a woman runs the risk of a burning remorse and a
sense of shame, which must make even the lover less dear.
An evening gaily passed, in care-devil thoughtless
fashion, is dearly paid for at the price. If a woman fears
she has made this kind of mistake before her lover, he
must become for days together hateful in her sight.
Can one wonder at the force of a habit, when the
lightest infractions of it are punished by such cruel
shame?</p>

<p>As for the utility of modesty&mdash;she is the mother of
love: impossible, therefore, to doubt her claims. And
for the mechanism of the sentiment&mdash;it's simple enough.
The soul is busy feeling shame instead of busy desiring.
You deny yourself desires and your desires lead to
actions.</p>

<p>Evidently every woman of feeling and pride&mdash;and,
these two things being cause and effect, one can hardly
go without the other&mdash;must fall into ways of coldness,
which the people whom they disconcert call prudery.</p>

<p>The accusation is all the more specious because of the
extreme difficulty of steering a middle course: a woman
has only to have little judgment and a lot of pride,
and very soon she will come to believe that in modesty one
cannot go too far. In this way, an Englishwoman takes
it as an insult, if you pronounce before her the name
of certain garments. An Englishwoman must be very
careful, in the country, not to be seen in the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>leaving the drawing-room with her husband; and, what
is still more serious, she thinks it an outrage to modesty,
to show that she is enjoying herself a little in the presence
of anyone <i>but</i> her husband.<a name="FNanchor_3_75" id="FNanchor_3_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_75" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is perhaps due to such
studied scrupulousness that the English, a people of
judgment, betray signs of such boredom in their domestic
bliss. Theirs the fault&mdash;why so much pride?<a name="FNanchor_4_76" id="FNanchor_4_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_76" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>To make up for this&mdash;and to pass straight from Plymouth
to Cadiz and Seville&mdash;I found in Spain that the warmth
of climate and passions caused people to overlook a little
the necessary measure of restraint. The very tender
caresses, which I noticed could be given in public, far
from seeming touching, inspired me with feelings quite
the reverse: nothing is more distressing.</p>

<p>We must expect to find incalculable the force of habits,
which insinuate themselves into women under the pretext
of modesty. A common woman, by carrying modesty
to extremes, feels she is getting on a level with a woman
of distinction.</p>

<p>Such is the empire of modesty, that a woman of feeling
betrays her sentiments for her lover sooner by deed than
by word.</p>

<p>The prettiest, richest and most easy-going woman of
Bologna has just told me, how yesterday evening a fool
of a Frenchman, who is here giving people a strange
idea of his nation, thought good to hide under her bed.
Apparently he did not want to waste the long string of
absurd declarations, with which he has been pestering
her for a month. But the great man should have had
more presence of mind. He waited all right till Madame
M&mdash;&mdash; sent away her maid and had got to bed, but he had
not the patience to give the household time to go to
sleep. She seized hold of the bell and had him thrown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>out ignominiously, in the midst of the jeers and cuffs of
five or six lackeys. "And if he had waited two hours?"
I asked her. "I should have been very badly off. 'Who
is to doubt,' he would have said, 'that I am here by your
orders?'"<a name="FNanchor_5_77" id="FNanchor_5_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_77" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>After leaving this pretty woman's house, I went to see
a woman more worthy of being loved than any I know.
Her extremely delicate nature is something greater, if
possible, than her touching beauty. I found her alone,
told the story of Madame M&mdash;&mdash; and we discussed it.
"Listen," was what she said; "if the man, who will go
as far as that, was lovable in the eyes of that woman
beforehand, he'll have her pardon, and, all in good time,
her love." I own I was dumbfounded by this unexpected
light thrown on the recesses of the human heart. After a
short silence I answered her&mdash;"But will a man, who
loves, dare go to such violent extremities?"</p>

<p>There would be far less vagueness in this chapter had
a woman written it. Everything relating to women's
haughtiness or pride, to their habits of modesty and its
excesses, to certain delicacies, for the most part dependent
wholly on associations of feelings,<a name="FNanchor_6_78" id="FNanchor_6_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_78" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which cannot exist
for men, and often delicacies not founded on Nature&mdash;all
these things, I say, can only find their way here so far
as it is permissible to write from hearsay.</p>

<p>A woman once said to me, in a moment of philosophical
frankness, something which amounts to this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"If ever I sacrificed my liberty, the man whom I
should happen to favour would appreciate still more my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>affection, by seeing how sparing I had always been of
favours&mdash;even of the slightest." It is out of preference
for this lover, whom perhaps she will never meet, that a
lovable woman will offer a cold reception to the man who
is speaking to her at the moment. That is the first
exaggeration of modesty; that one can respect. The
second comes from women's pride. The third source of
exaggeration is the pride of husbands.</p>

<p>To my idea, this possibility of love presents itself often
to the fancy of even the most virtuous woman&mdash;and
why not? Not to love, when given by Heaven a soul
made for love, is to deprive yourself and others of a great
blessing. It is like an orange-tree, which would not
flower for fear of committing a sin. And beyond
doubt a soul made for love can partake fervently of no
other bliss. In the would-be pleasures of the world it
finds, already at the second trial, an intolerable emptiness.
Often it fancies that it loves Art and Nature in its
grander aspects, but all they do for it is to hold out hopes
of love and magnify it, if that is possible; until, very
soon, it finds out that they speak of a happiness which it
is resolved to forego.</p>

<p>The only thing I see to blame in modesty is that it
leads to untruthfulness, and that is the only point of
vantage, which light women have over women of feeling.
A light woman says to you: "As soon, my friend, as you
attract me, I'll tell you and I'll be more delighted than
you; because I have a great respect for you."</p>

<p>The lively satisfaction of Constance's cry after her
lover's victory! "How happy I am, not to have given
myself to anyone, all these eight years that I've been on
bad terms with my husband!"</p>

<p>However comical I find the line of thought, this joy
seems to me full of freshness.</p>

<p>Here I absolutely must talk about the sort of regrets,
felt by a certain lady of Seville who had been deserted
by her lover. I ought to remind the reader that, in love.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>everything is a sign, and, above all, crave the benefit of
a little indulgence for my style.<a name="FNanchor_7_79" id="FNanchor_7_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_79" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a man, I think my eye can distinguish nine points
in modesty.</p>

<p>1. Much is staked against little; hence extreme reserve;
hence often affectation. For example, one doesn't
laugh at what amuses one the most. Hence it needs
a great deal of judgment to have just the right amount
of modesty.<a name="FNanchor_8_80" id="FNanchor_8_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_80" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> That is why many women have not enough
in intimate gatherings, or, to put it more exactly, do not
insist on the stories told them being sufficiently disguised,
and only drop their veils according to the degree of their
intoxication or recklessness.<a name="FNanchor_9_81" id="FNanchor_9_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_81" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Could it be an effect of modesty and of the deadly
dullness it must impose on many women, that the majority
of them respect nothing in a man so much as impudence?
Or do they take impudence for character?</p>

<p>2. Second law: "My lover will think the more of me
for it."</p>

<p>3. Force of habit has its way, even at the moments
of greatest passion.</p>

<p>4. To the lover, modesty offers very flattering pleasures;
it makes him feel what laws are broken for his
sake.</p>

<p>5. And to women it offers more intoxicating pleasures,
which, causing the fall of a strongly established habit,
throw the soul into greater confusion. The Comte de
Valmont finds himself in a pretty woman's bedroom at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>midnight. The thing happens every week to him; to
her perhaps every other year. Thus continence and
modesty must have pleasures infinitely more lively in
store for women.<a name="FNanchor_10_82" id="FNanchor_10_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_82" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>6. The drawback of modesty is that it is always leading
to falsehood.</p>

<p>7. Excess of modesty, and its severity, discourages
gentle and timid hearts from loving<a name="FNanchor_11_83" id="FNanchor_11_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_83" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&mdash;just those made
for giving and feeling the sweets of love.</p>

<p>8. In sensitive women, who have not had several lovers,
modesty is a bar to ease of manner, and for this reason they
are rather apt to let themselves be led by those friends,
who need reproach themselves with no such failing.<a name="FNanchor_12_84" id="FNanchor_12_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_84" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
They go into each particular case, instead of falling back
blindly on habit. Delicacy and modesty give their
actions a touch of restraint; by being natural they make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>themselves appear unnatural; but this awkwardness is
akin to heavenly grace.</p>

<p>If familiarity in them sometimes resembles tenderness,
it is because these angelic souls are coquettes without
knowing it. They are disinclined to interrupt their
dreams, and, to save themselves the trouble of speaking
and finding something both pleasant and polite to say to
a friend (which would end in being nothing but polite),
they finish by leaning tenderly on his arm.<a name="FNanchor_13_85" id="FNanchor_13_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_85" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>9. Women only dare be frank by halves; which is the
reason why they very rarely reach the highest, when
they become authors, but which also gives a grace to
their shortest note. For them to be frank means going
out without a <i>fichu</i>. For a man nothing more frequent
than to write absolutely at the dictate of his
imagination, without knowing where he is going.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Résumé</i>
</p>

<p>The usual fault is to treat woman as a kind of man, but
more generous, more changeable and with whom, above
all, no rivalry is possible. It is only too easy to forget
that there are two new and peculiar laws, which tyrannise
over these unstable beings, in conflict with all
the ordinary impulses of human nature&mdash;I mean:&mdash;</p>

<p>Feminine pride and modesty, and those often inscrutable
habits born of modesty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">THE GLANCE</span></h3>


<p>This is the great weapon of virtuous coquetry.
With a glance, one may say everything, and yet
one can always deny a glance; for it cannot be repeated
textually.</p>

<p>This reminds me of Count G&mdash;&mdash;, the Mirabeau of Rome.
The delightful little government of that land has taught
him an original way of telling stories by a broken string
of words, which say everything&mdash;and nothing. He makes
his whole meaning clear, but repeat who will his sayings
word for word, it is impossible to compromise him.
Cardinal Lante told him he had stolen this talent from
women&mdash;yes, and respectable women, I add. This
roguery is a cruel, but just, reprisal on man's tyranny.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF FEMININE PRIDE</span></h3>


<p>All their lives women hear mention made by men
of things claiming importance&mdash;large profits, success
in war, people killed in duels, fiendish or admirable
revenges, and so on. Those of them, whose heart is
proud, feel that, being unable to reach these things,
they are not in a position to display any pride remarkable
for the importance of what it rests on. They feel a
heart beat in their breast, superior by the force and pride
of its movements to all which surrounds them, and yet
they see the meanest of men esteem himself above them.
They find out, that all their pride can only be for little
things, or at least for things, which are without importance
except for sentiment, and of which a third party
cannot judge. Maddened by this desolating contrast
between the meanness of their fortune and the conscious
worth of their soul, they set about making their pride
worthy of respect by the intensity of its fits or by the
relentless tenacity with which they hold by its dictates.
Before intimate intercourse women of this kind imagine,
when they see their lover, that he has laid siege to them.
Their imagination is absorbed in irritation at his endeavours,
which, after all, cannot do otherwise than witness
to his love&mdash;seeing that he does love. Instead of enjoying
the feelings of the man of their preference, their vanity
is up in arms against him; and it comes to this, that,
with a soul of the tenderest, so long as its sensibility is not
centred on a special object, they have only to love, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>order, like a common flirt, to be reduced to the barest
vanity.</p>

<p>A woman of generous character will sacrifice her life a
thousand times for her lover, but will break with him
for ever over a question of pride&mdash;for the opening or
shutting of a door. Therein lies their point of honour.
Well! Napoleon came to grief rather than yield a
village.</p>

<p>I have seen a quarrel of this kind last longer than a
year. It was a woman of the greatest distinction who
sacrificed all her happiness, sooner than give her lover
the chance of entertaining the slightest possible doubt of
the magnanimity of her pride. The reconciliation was
the work of chance, and, on my friend's side, due to a
moment of weakness, which, on meeting her lover, she
was unable to overcome. She imagined him forty miles
away, and found him in a place, where certainly he did
not expect to see her. She could not hide the first transports
of delight; her lover was more overcome than
she; they almost fell at each other's feet and never have
I seen tears flow so abundantly&mdash;it was the unlooked-for
appearance of happiness. Tears are the supreme smile.</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyll gave a fine example of presence of
mind, in not drawing Feminine Pride into a combat, in
the interview he had at Richmond with Queen Caroline.<a name="FNanchor_1_86" id="FNanchor_1_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_86" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>

terrible are these storms&mdash;</p>

<p>Can it be that the more fervently, in the normal
course of life, a woman delights in the rare qualities of
her lover, the more she tries, in those cruel moments,
when sympathy seems turned to the reverse, to wreak
her vengeance on what usually she sees in him superior
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>to other people? She is afraid of being confounded with
them.</p>

<p>It is a precious long time since I read that boring
<i>Clarissa</i>; but I think it is through feminine pride that
she lets herself die, and does not accept the hand of
Lovelace.</p>

<p>Lovelace's fault was great; but as she did love him a
little, she could have found pardon in her heart for a
crime, of which the cause was love.</p>

<p>Monime, on the contrary, seems to me a touching
model of feminine delicacy. What cheek does not blush
with pleasure to hear from the lips of an actress worthy
of the part:&mdash;</p>

<p>The woman, who speaks with so much restraint, had
suffered in secret the fate of Desdemona, and, by a word,
could make known her husband's crime to the friends,
whom she had left on earth.</p>

<p>Nello della Pietra won the hand of Madonna Pia<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_14" id="TNanch_14"></a><a href="#TN_14">(14)</a></span>,
sole heiress of the Tolomei, the richest and noblest family
of Sienna. Her beauty, which was the admiration of
Tuscany, sowed in her husband's heart the seed of
jealousy, which, envenomed by false reports and suspicions
ever and anon rekindled, led him to a heinous
project. It is difficult, at this hour, to decide whether
his wife was altogether innocent, but Dante represents
her as such.</p>

<p>Her husband carried her off into the fens of Volterra,
famous then, as now, for the effects of the <i>aria cattiva</i>.
Never would he tell his unhappy wife the reason of her
exile in so dangerous a place. His pride did not deign
to utter complaint or accusation. He lived alone with
her in a deserted tower, the ruins of which by the edge
of the sea I have been myself to visit. There he never
broke his scornful silence, never answered his young
wife's questions, never listened to her prayers. Coldly
he waited at her side for the pestilential air to have its
effect. The exhalations of these morasses were not long
in withering those features&mdash;the loveliest, it is said,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>which, in that century, the world had seen. In a few
months she died. Some chroniclers of those remote
times report that Nello used the dagger to hasten her
end. She died in the fens in some horrible way; but
the kind of death was a mystery even to her contemporaries.
Nello della Pietra survived to pass the rest of his
days in a silence which he never broke.</p>

<p>Nothing nobler and more delicate than the way in
which young la Pia addresses Dante. She wishes to be
recalled to the memory of the friends, whom she had
left on earth so young; and yet, telling who she is and
giving the name of her husband, she will not allow herself
the slightest complaint against a piece of cruelty unheard
of, but for the future irreparable; she only points out
that he knows the story of her death.</p>

<p>This constancy in pride's revenge is not met, I think,
except in the countries of the South.</p>

<p>In Piedmont I happened to be the involuntary witness
of something very nearly parallel; though at the time
I did not know the details. I was sent with twenty-five
dragoons into the woods along the Sesia, to intercept
contraband. Arriving in the evening at this wild and
desolate spot, I caught sight between the trees of the
ruins of an old castle. I went up to it and to my
great surprise&mdash;it was inhabited. I found within a
nobleman of the country, of sinister appearance, a man
six foot high and forty years old. He gave me two rooms
with a bad grace. I passed my time playing music with
my quartermaster; after some days, we discovered that
our friend kept a woman in the background, whom we
used to call Camille, laughingly; but we were far from
suspecting the fearful truth. Six weeks later she was
dead. I had the morbid curiosity to see her in the coffin,
paying a monk, who was watching, to introduce me into
the chapel towards midnight, under pretext of going to
sprinkle holy water. There I found one of those superb
faces, which are beautiful even in the arms of death;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>she had a large aquiline nose&mdash;the nobility and delicacy
of its outline I shall never forget. Then I left that
deadly spot. Five years later, a detachment of my
regiment accompanying the Emperor to his coronation
as King of Italy<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_15" id="TNanch_15"></a><a href="#TN_15">(15)</a></span>, I had the whole story told me. I
learnt that the jealous husband, Count &mdash;&mdash;, had found
one morning fastened to his wife's bed an English watch,
belonging to a young man of the small town in which
they lived. That very day he carried her off to the
ruined castle in the midst of the woods of the Sesia.
Like Nello della Pietra, he never uttered a single word.
If she made him any request, he coldly and silently
presented to her the English watch, which he carried
always with him. Almost three years passed, spent thus
alone with her. At last she died of despair, in the flower
of life. Her husband tried to put a knife into the proprietor
of the watch, missed him, passed on to Genoa,
took ship and no one has heard of him since. His property
has been divided.</p>

<p>As for these women with feminine pride, if you take
their injuries with a good grace, which the habits of a
military life make easy, you annoy these proud souls;
they take you for a coward, and very soon become outrageous.
Such lofty characters yield with pleasure to
men whom they see overbearing with other men. That
is, I fancy, the only way&mdash;you must often pick a quarrel
with your neighbour in order to avoid one with your
mistress.</p>

<p>One day Miss Cornel, the celebrated London actress,
was surprised by the unexpected appearance of the rich
colonel, whom she found useful. She happened to be with
a little lover, whom she just liked&mdash;and nothing more.
"Mr. So-and-so," says she in great confusion to the
colonel, "has come to see the pony I want to sell."
"I am here for something very different," put in
proudly the little lover who was beginning to bore her,
but whom, from the moment of that answer, she started
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>to love again madly.<a name="FNanchor_5_90" id="FNanchor_5_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_90" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Women of that kind sympathise
with their lover's haughtiness, instead of exercising at
his expense their own disposition to pride.</p>

<p>The character of the Duc de Lauzun (that of 1660<a name="FNanchor_6_91" id="FNanchor_6_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_91" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>),
if they can forgive the first day its want of grace, is very
fascinating for such women, and perhaps for all women
of distinction. Grandeur on a higher plane escapes
them; they take for coldness the calm gaze which
nothing escapes, but which a detail never disturbs. Have
I not heard women at the Court of Saint-Cloud maintain
that Napoleon had a dry and prosaic character?<a name="FNanchor_7_92" id="FNanchor_7_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_92" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A
great man is like an eagle: the higher he rises the less
he is visible, and he is punished for his greatness by the
solitude of his soul.</p>

<p>From feminine pride arises what women call want of
refinement. I fancy, it is not at all unlike what kings
call <i>lèse majesté</i>, a crime all the more dangerous, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>one slips into it without knowing. The tenderest lover
may be accused of wanting refinement, if he is not very
sharp, or, what is sadder, if he dares give himself up to
the greatest charm of love&mdash;the delight of being perfectly
natural with the loved one and of not listening
to what he is told.</p>

<p>These are the sort of things, of which a well-born
heart could have no inkling; one must have experience,
in order to believe in them; for we are misled by the habit
of dealing justly and frankly with our men friends.</p>

<p>It is necessary to keep in mind incessantly that we
have to do with beings, who can, however wrongly,
think themselves inferior in vigour of character, or, to
put it better, can think that others believe they are
inferior.</p>

<p>Should not a woman's true pride reside in the power
of the feeling she inspires? A maid of honour to the
queen and wife of Francis I was chaffed about the fickleness
of her lover, who, it was said, did not really love her.
A little time after, this lover had an illness and reappeared
at Court&mdash;dumb. Two years later, people showing surprise
one day that she still loved him, she turned to him,
saying: "Speak." And he spoke.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF WOMEN'S COURAGE</span></h3>

<p class="quotl">I tell thee, proud Templar, that not in thy fiercest battles hast thou
displayed more of thy vaunted courage than has been shewn by women,
when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. (<i>Ivanhoe</i>.)</p>


<p>I remember meeting the following phrase in a
book of history: "All the men lost their head:
that is the moment when women display an incontestable
superiority."</p>

<p>Their courage has a reserve which that of their lover
wants; he acts as a spur to their sense of worth. They
find so much pleasure in being able, in the fire of danger,
to dispute the first place for firmness with the man,
who often wounds them by the proudness of his protection
and his strength, that the vehemence of that enjoyment
raises them above any kind of fear, which at the
moment is the man's weak point. A man, too, if the
same help were given him at the same moment, would
show himself superior to everything; for fear never
resides in the danger, but in ourselves.</p>

<p>Not that I mean to depreciate women's courage&mdash;I
have seen them, on occasions, superior to the bravest
men. Only they must have a man to love. Then they
no longer feel except through him; and so the most
obvious and personal danger becomes, as it were, a rose
to gather in his presence.<a name="FNanchor_1_93" id="FNanchor_1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_93" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I have found also in women, who did not love, intrepidity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>the coldest, the most surprising and the most
exempt from nerves.</p>

<p>It is true, I have always imagined that they are so
brave, only because they do not know the tiresomeness
of wounds!</p>

<p>As for moral courage, so far superior to the other, the
firmness of a woman who resists her love is simply the
most admirable thing, which can exist on earth. All other
possible marks of courage are as nothing compared to a
thing so strongly opposed to nature and so arduous.
Perhaps they find a source of strength in the habit of
sacrifice, which is bred in them by modesty.</p>

<p>Hard on women it is that the proofs of this courage
should always remain secret and be almost impossible
to divulge.</p>

<p>Still harder that it should always be employed against
their own happiness: the Princesse de Clèves would have
done better to say nothing to her husband and give
herself to M. de Nemours.</p>

<p>Perhaps women are chiefly supported by their pride in
making a fine defence, and imagine that their lover is
staking his vanity on having them&mdash;a petty and miserable
idea. A man of passion, who throws himself
with a light heart into so many ridiculous situations,
must have a lot of time to be thinking of vanity!
It is like the monks who mean to catch the devil and
find their reward in the pride of hair-shirts and macerations.</p>

<p>I should think that Madame de Clèves would have
repented, had she come to old age,&mdash;to the period at
which one judges life and when the joys of pride appear
in all their meanness. She would have wished to have
lived like Madame de la Fayette.<a name="FNanchor_2_94" id="FNanchor_2_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_94" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>I have just re-read a hundred pages of this essay: and
a pretty poor idea I have given of true love, of love
which occupies the entire soul, fills it with fancies, now
the happiest, now heart-breaking&mdash;but always sublime&mdash;and
makes it completely insensible to all the rest of
creation. I am at a loss to express what I see so well;
I have never felt more painfully the want of talent.
How bring into relief the simplicity of action and of
character, the high seriousness, the glance that reflects
so truly and so ingenuously the passing shade of feeling,
and above all, to return to it again, that inexpressible
<i>What care I?</i> for all that is not the woman we love?
A yes or a no spoken by a man in love has an <i>unction</i>
which is not to be found elsewhere, and is not found in
that very man at other times. This morning (August
3rd) I passed on horseback about nine o'clock in front
of the lovely English garden of Marchese Zampieri,
situated on the last crests of those tree-capped hills, on
which Bologna rests, and from which so fine a view is
enjoyed over Lombardy rich and green&mdash;the fairest
country in the world. In a copse of laurels, belonging
to the Giardino Zampieri, which dominates the path I
was taking, leading to the cascade of the Reno at Casa
Lecchio, I saw Count Delfante. He was absorbed in
thought and scarcely returned my greeting, though we
had passed the night together till two o'clock in the morning.
I went to the cascade, I crossed the Reno; after
which, passing again, at least three hours later, under the
copse of the Giardino Zampieri, I saw him still there. He
was precisely in the same position, leaning against a great
pine, which rises above the copse of laurels&mdash;but this detail
I am afraid will be found too simple and pointless. He
came up to me with tears in his eyes, asking me not
to go telling people of his trance. I was touched, and
suggested retracing my steps and going with him to
spend the day in the country. At the end of two
hours he had told me everything. His is a fine soul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>but oh! the coldness of these pages, compared to his
story.</p>

<p>Furthermore, he thinks his love is not returned&mdash;which
is not my opinion. In the fair marble face of
the Contessa Ghigi, with whom we spent the evening,
one can read nothing. Only now and then a light and
sudden blush, which she cannot check, just betrays the
emotions of that soul, which the most exalted feminine
pride disputes with deeper emotions. You see the
colour spread over her neck of alabaster and as much as
one catches of those lovely shoulders, worthy of Canova.
She somehow finds a way of diverting her black and sombre
eyes from the observation of those, whose penetration
alarms her woman's delicacy; but last night, at something
which Delfante was saying and of which she disapproved,
I saw a sudden blush spread all over her. Her
lofty soul found him less worthy of her.</p>

<p>But when all is said, even if I were mistaken in my
conjectures on the happiness of Delfante, vanity apart,
I think him happier than I, in my indifference, although
I am in a thoroughly happy position, in appearance and
in reality.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">A PECULIAR AND MOURNFUL SPECTACLE</span></h3>


<p>Women with their feminine pride visit the iniquities
of the fools upon the men of sense,
and those of the prosaic, prosperous and brutal upon the
noble-minded. A very pretty result&mdash;you'll agree!</p>

<p>The petty considerations of pride and worldly proprieties
are the cause of many women's unhappiness, for,
through pride, their parents have placed them in their
abominable position. Destiny has reserved for them,
as a consolation far superior to all their misfortunes, the
happiness of loving and being loved with passion, when
suddenly one fine day they borrow from the enemy this
same mad pride, of which they were the first victims&mdash;all
to kill the one happiness which is left them, to work
their own misfortune and the misfortune of him, who
loves them. A friend, who has had ten famous intrigues
(and by no means all one after another), gravely
persuades them that if they fall in love, they will be
dishonoured in the eyes of the public, and yet this worthy
public, who never rises above low ideas, gives them
generously a lover a year; because that, it says, "is the
thing." Thus the soul is saddened by this odd spectacle:
a woman of feeling, supremely refined and an angel of
purity, on the advice of a low t&mdash;&mdash;, runs away from the
boundless, the only happiness which is left to her, in
order to appear in a dress of dazzling white, before a
great fat brute of a judge, whom everyone knows has
been blind a hundred years, and who bawls out at the
top of his voice: "She is dressed in black!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">EXTRACT FROM THE DIARY OF SALVIATI</span></h3>

<p class="quotr">Ingenium nobis ipsa puella facit.<br />
(<i>Propertius</i>, II, <span class="smcap">i</span>.)</p>


<p>Bologna, <i>April 29th</i>, 1818.</p>

<p>Driven to despair by the misfortune to which
love has reduced me, I curse existence. I have no heart
for anything. The weather is dull; it is raining, and a
late spell of cold has come again to sadden nature, who
after a long winter was hurrying to meet the spring.</p>

<p>Schiassetti, a half-pay colonel, my cold and reasonable
friend, came to spend a couple of hours with me
"You should renounce your love."</p>

<p>"How? Give me back my passion for war."</p>

<p>"It is a great misfortune for you to have known her."</p>

<p>I agree very nearly&mdash;so low-spirited and craven
do I feel&mdash;so much has melancholy taken possession
of me to-day. We discuss what interest can have led
her friend to libel me, but find nothing but that old
Neapolitan proverb: "Woman, whom love and youth
desert, a nothing piques." What is certain is that that
cruel woman is <i>enraged</i> with me&mdash;it is the expression of
one of her friends. I could revenge myself in a fearful
way, but, against her hatred, I am without the smallest
means of defence. Schiassetti leaves me. I go out into
the rain, not knowing what to do with myself. My
rooms, this drawing-room, which I lived in during the
first days of our acquaintance, and when I saw her every
evening, have become insupportable to me. Each engraving,
each piece of furniture, brings up again the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>happiness I dreamed of in their presence&mdash;which now I
have lost for ever.</p>

<p>I tramped the streets through a cold rain: chance, if
I can call it chance, made me pass under her windows.
Night was falling and I went along, my eyes full of tears
fixed on the window of her room. Suddenly the curtains
were just drawn aside, as if to give a glimpse into the
square, then instantly closed again. I felt within me a
physical movement about the heart. I was unable to
support myself and took refuge under the gateway of
the next house. A thousand feelings crowd upon my
soul. Chance may have produced this movement of the
curtains; but oh! if it was her hand that had drawn
them aside.</p>

<p>There are two misfortunes in the world: passion
frustrated and the "dead blank."</p>

<p>In love&mdash;I feel that two steps away from me exists
a boundless happiness, something beyond all my prayers,
which depends upon nothing but a word, nothing but a
smile.</p>

<p>Passionless like Schiassetti, on gloomy days I see
happiness nowhere, I come to doubt if it exists for
me, I fall into depression. One ought to be without
strong passions and have only a little curiosity or vanity.</p>

<p>It is two o'clock in the morning; I have seen that
little movement of the curtain; at six o'clock I paid some
calls and went to the play, but everywhere, silent and
dreaming, I passed the evening examining this question:
"After so much anger with so little foundation (for
after all did I wish to offend her and is there a thing on
earth which the intention does not excuse?)&mdash;has she
felt a moment of love?"</p>

<p>Poor Salviati, who wrote the preceding lines on his
Petrarch, died a short time after. He was the intimate
friend of Schiassetti and myself; we knew all his thoughts,
and it is from him that I have all the tearful part of
this essay. He was imprudence incarnate; moreover,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>the woman, for whom he went to such wild lengths, is
the most interesting creature that I have met. Schiassetti
said to me: "But do you think that that unfortunate
passion was without advantages for Salviati? To begin
with, the most worrying of money troubles that can be
imagined came upon him. These troubles, which reduced
him to a very middling fortune after his dazzling youth,
and would have driven him mad with anger in any other
circumstances, crossed his mind not once in two weeks.</p>

<p>"And then&mdash;a matter of importance of a quite different
kind for a mind of his range&mdash;that passion is the first
true course of logic, which he ever had. That may seem
peculiar in a man who has been at Court; but the fact
is explained by his extreme courage. For example, he
passed without winking the day of &mdash;&mdash;, the day of his
undoing; he was surprised then, as in Russia<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_16" id="TNanch_16"></a><a href="#TN_16">(16)</a></span>, not to
feel anything extraordinary. It is an actual fact, that his
fear of anything had never gone so far as to make him
think about it for two days together. Instead of this
callousness, the last two years he was trying every minute
to be brave. Before he had never seen danger.</p>

<p>"When as a result of his imprudence and his faith in
the generosity of critics,<a name="FNanchor_1_95" id="FNanchor_1_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_95" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> he had managed to get condemned
to not seeing the woman he was in love with,
except twice a month, we would see him pass those evenings,
talking to her as if intoxicated with joy, because he
had been received with that noble frankness which he
worshipped. He held that Madame &mdash;&mdash; and he were
two souls without their like, who should understand each
other with a glance. It was beyond him to grasp that
she should pay the least attention to petty bourgeois
comments, which tried to make a criminal of him. The
result of this fine confidence in a woman, surrounded by his
enemies, was to find her door closed to him.</p>

<p>"'With M&mdash;&mdash;,' I used to say to him, 'you forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>your maxim&mdash;that you mustn't believe in greatness of
soul, except in the last extremity.'</p>

<p>"'Do you think,' he answered, 'that the world contains
another heart which is more suited to hers? True,
I pay for this passionate way of being, which Léonore,
in anger, made me see on the horizon in the line of the
rocks of Poligny, with the ruin of all the practical enterprises
of my life&mdash;a disaster which comes from my lack
of patient industry and imprudence due to the force of
momentary impressions.'" One can see the touch of
madness!</p>

<p>For Salviati life was divided into periods of a fortnight,
which took their hue from the last interview, which he
had been granted. But I noticed often, that the happiness
he owed to a welcome, which he thought less cold,
was far inferior in intensity to the unhappiness with which
a hard reception overwhelmed him.<a name="FNanchor_2_96" id="FNanchor_2_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_96" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At times Madame
---- failed to be quite honest with him; and these are
the only two criticisms I ever dared offer him. Beyond
the more intimate side of his sorrow, of which he had
the delicacy never to speak even to the friends dearest
to him and most devoid of envy, he saw in a hard reception
from Léonore the triumph of prosaic and scheming
beings over the open-hearted and the generous. At those
times he lost faith in virtue and, above all, in glory. It was
his way to talk to his friends only of sad notions, to
which it is true his passion led up, but notions capable
besides of having some interest in the eyes of philosophy.
I was curious to observe that uncommon soul. Ordinarily
passion-love is found in people, a little simple in the
German way.<a name="FNanchor_3_97" id="FNanchor_3_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_97" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Salviati, on the contrary, was among the
firmest and sharpest men I have known.</p>

<p>I seemed to notice that, after these cruel visits, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>no peace until he had found a justification for Léonore's
severities. So long as he felt that she might have been
wrong in ill-using him, he was unhappy. Love, so devoid
of vanity, I should never have thought possible.</p>

<p>He was incessantly singing us the praises of love.</p>

<p>"If a supernatural power said to me: Break the glass
of that watch and Léonore will be for you, what she was
three years ago, an indifferent friend&mdash;really I believe I
would never as long as I live have the courage to break
it." I saw in these discourses such signs of madness, that
I never had the courage to offer my former objections.</p>

<p>He would add: "Just as Luther's Reformation at the
end of the Middle Ages, shaking society to its base,
renewed and reconstructed the world on reasonable
foundations, so is a generous character renewed and retempered
by love.</p>

<p>"It is only then, that he casts off all the baubles of
life; without this revolution he would always have had
in him a pompous and theatrical <i>something</i>. It is only
since I began to love that I have learnt to put greatness
into my character&mdash;such is the absurdity of education at
our military academy.</p>

<p>"Although I behaved well, I was a child at the Court
of Napoleon and at Moscow. I did my duty, but I
knew nothing of that heroic simplicity, the fruit of entire
and whole-hearted sacrifice. For example, it is only this
last year, that my heart takes in the simplicity of the
Romans in Livy. Once upon a time, I thought them cold
compared to our brilliant colonels. What they did for
their Rome, I find in my heart for Léonore. If I had the
luck to be able to do anything for her, my first desire
would be to hide it. The conduct of a Regulus or a
Decius was something confirmed beforehand, which had
no claim to surprise them. Before I loved, I was small,
precisely because I was tempted sometimes to think
myself great; I felt a certain effort, for which I
applauded myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>"And, on the side of affection, what do we not owe
to love? After the hazards of early youth, the heart is
closed to sympathy. Death and absence remove our early
companions, and we are reduced to passing our life with
lukewarm partners, measure in hand, for ever calculating
ideas of interest and vanity. Little by little all the sensitive
and generous region of the soul becomes waste, for
want of cultivation, and at less than thirty a man finds
his heart steeled to all sweet and gentle sensations. In
the midst of this arid desert, love causes a well of feelings
to spring up, fresher and more abundant even than that
of earliest youth. In those days it was a vague hope,
irresponsible and incessantly distracted<a name="FNanchor_4_98" id="FNanchor_4_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_98" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;no devotion
to one thing, no deep and constant desire; the soul, at
all times light, was athirst for novelty and forgot to-day
its adoration of the day before. But, than the crystallisation
of love nothing is more concentrated, more mysterious,
more eternally single in its object. In those days
only agreeable things claimed to please and to please
for an instant: now we are deeply touched by everything
which is connected with the loved one&mdash;even by
objects the most indifferent. Arriving at a great town,
a hundred miles from that which Léonore lives in, I
was in a state of fear and trembling; at each street
corner I shuddered to meet Alviza, the intimate friend of
Madame &mdash;&mdash;, although I did not know her. For me
everything took a mysterious and sacred tint. My heart
beat fast, while talking to an old scholar; for I could not
hear without blushing the name of the city gate, near
which the friend of Léonore lives.</p>

<p>"Even the severities of the woman we love have an
infinite grace, which the most flattering moments in the
company of other women cannot offer. It is like the great
shadows in Correggio's pictures, which far from being,
as in other painters, passages less pleasant, but necessary
in order to give effect to the lights and relief to the figures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>have graces of their own which charm and throw us into
a gentle reverie.<a name="FNanchor_5_99" id="FNanchor_5_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_99" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>"Yes, half and the fairest half of life is hidden from
the man, who has not loved with passion."</p>

<p>Salviati had need of the whole force of his dialectic
powers, to hold his own against the wise Schiassetti, who
was always saying to him: "You want to be happy,
then be content with a life exempt from pains and with
a small quantity of happiness every day. Keep yourself
from the lottery of great passions."</p>

<p>"Then give me your curiosity," was Salviati's answer.</p>

<p>I imagine there were not a few days, when he would
have liked to be able to follow the advice of our sensible
colonel; he made a little struggle and thought he was
succeeding; but this line of action was absolutely beyond
his strength. And yet what strength was in that soul!</p>

<p>A white satin hat, a little like that of Madame &mdash;&mdash;,
seen in the distance in the street, made his heart stop
beating, and forced him to rest against the wall. Even
in his blackest moments, the happiness of meeting her
gave him always some hours of intoxication, beyond the
reach of all misfortune and all reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_6_100" id="FNanchor_6_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_100" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For the rest,
at the time of his death<a name="FNanchor_7_101" id="FNanchor_7_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_101" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> his character had certainly contracted
more than one noble habit, after two years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>this generous and boundless passion; and, in so far at
least, he judged himself correctly. Had he lived,
and circumstances helped him a little, he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>have made a name for himself. Maybe also, just
through his simplicity, his merit would have passed
on this earth unseen.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF INTIMATE INTERCOURSE</span></h3>


<p>The greatest happiness that love can give&mdash;'tis first
joining your hand to the hand of a woman you love.</p>

<p>The happiness of gallantry is quite otherwise&mdash;far
more real, and far more subject to ridicule.</p>

<p>In passion-love intimate intercourse is not so much
perfect delight itself, as the last step towards it.</p>

<p>But how depict a delight, which leaves no memories
behind?</p>

<p>Mortimer returned from a long voyage in fear and
trembling; he adored Jenny, but Jenny had not answered
his letters. On his arrival in London, he mounts
his horse and goes off to find her at her country
home. When he gets there, she is walking in the park;
he runs up to her, with beating heart, meets her and she
offers him her hand and greets him with emotion; he
sees that she loves him. Roaming together along the
glades of the park, Jenny's dress became entangled in
an acacia bush. Later on Mortimer won her; but
Jenny was faithless. I maintain to him that Jenny
never loved him and he quotes, as proof of her love, the
way in which she received him at his return from the
Continent; but he could never give me the slightest
details of it. Only he shudders visibly directly he sees
an acacia bush: really, it is the only distinct remembrance
he succeeded in preserving of the happiest moment of
his life.<a name="FNanchor_1_103" id="FNanchor_1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_103" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>A sensitive and open man, a former <i>chevalier</i>, confided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>to me this evening (in the depth of our craft buffeted
by a high sea on the Lago di Garda<a name="FNanchor_2_104" id="FNanchor_2_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_104" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>) the history of his
loves, which I in my turn shall not confide to the public.
But I feel myself in a position to conclude from them
that the day of intimate intercourse is like those fine days
in May, a critical period for the fairest flowers, a moment
which can be fatal and wither in an instant the fairest
hopes.</p>

<p class="tb"><a name="FNanchor_3_105" id="FNanchor_3_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_105" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><i>Naturalness</i> cannot be praised too highly. It is the
only coquetry permissible in a thing so serious as love
<i>à la</i> Werther; in which a man has no idea where he is
going, and in which at the same time by a lucky chance for
virtue, that is his best policy. A man, really moved, says
charming things unconsciously; he speaks a language
which he does not know himself.</p>

<p>Woe to the man the least bit affected! Given he were
in love, allow him all the wit in the world, he loses
three-quarters of his advantages. Let him relapse for an
instant into affectation&mdash;a minute later comes a moment
of frost.</p>

<p>The whole art of love, as it seems to me, reduces itself
to saying exactly as much as the degree of intoxication at
the moment allows of, that is to say in other terms, to
listen to one's heart. It must not be thought, that this is
so easy; a man, who truly loves, has no longer strength to
speak, when his mistress says anything to make him happy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>Thus he loses the deeds which his words<a name="FNanchor_4_106" id="FNanchor_4_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_106" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> would have
given birth to. It is better to be silent than say things
too tender at the wrong time, and what was in point
ten seconds ago, is now no longer&mdash;in fact at this moment
it makes a mess of things. Every time that I used to
infringe this rule<a name="FNanchor_5_107" id="FNanchor_5_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_107" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and say something, which had come
into my head three minutes earlier and which I thought
pretty, Léonore never failed to punish me. And later I
would say to myself, as I went away&mdash;"She is right." This
is the sort of thing to upset women of delicacy extremely;
it is indecency of sentiment. Like tasteless rhetoricians,
they are readier to admit a certain degree of weakness
and coldness. There being nothing in the world to
alarm them but the falsity of their lover, the least little
insincerity of detail, be it the most innocent in the world,
robs them instantly of all delight and puts mistrust into
their heart.</p>

<p>Respectable women have a repugnance to what is
vehement and unlooked for&mdash;those being none the less
characteristics of passion&mdash;and, furthermore, that vehemence
alarms their modesty; they are on the defensive
against it.</p>

<p>When a touch of jealousy or displeasure has occasioned
some chilliness, it is generally possible to begin subjects,
fit to give birth to the excitement favourable to love,
and, after the first two or three phrases of introduction,
as long as a man does not miss the opportunity of saying
exactly what his heart suggests, the pleasure he will give
to his loved one will be keen. The fault of most men is
that they want to succeed in saying something, which
they think either pretty or witty or touching&mdash;instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>releasing their soul from the false gravity of the world,
until a degree of intimacy and <i>naturalness</i> brings out in
simple language what they are feeling at the moment.
The man, who is brave enough for this, will have instantly
his reward in a kind of peacemaking.</p>

<p>It is this reward, as swift as it is involuntary, of the
pleasure one gives to the object of one's love, which puts
this passion so far above the others.</p>

<p>If there is perfect <i>naturalness</i> between them, the
happiness of two individuals comes to be fused together.<a name="FNanchor_6_108" id="FNanchor_6_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_108" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This is simply the greatest happiness which can exist,
by reason of sympathy and several other laws of human
nature.</p>

<p>It is quite easy to determine the meaning of this
word <i>naturalness</i>&mdash;essential condition of happiness in
love.</p>

<p>We call <i>natural</i> that which does not diverge from an
habitual way of acting. It goes without saying that one
must not merely never lie to one's love, but not even
embellish the least bit or tamper with the simple outline
of truth. For if a man is embellishing, his attention is
occupied in doing so and no longer answers simply and
truly, as the keys of a piano, to the feelings mirrored
in his eye. The woman finds it out at once by a certain
chilliness within her, and she, in her turn, falls back on
coquetry. Might not here be found hidden the cause
why it is impossible to love a woman with a mind too
far below one's own&mdash;the reason being that, in her case,
one can make pretence with impunity, and, as that
course is more convenient, one abandons oneself to unnaturalness
by force of habit? From that moment love
is no longer love; it sinks to the level of an ordinary
transaction&mdash;the only difference being that, instead of
money, you get pleasure or flattery or a mixture of both.
It is hard not to feel a shade of contempt for a woman,
before whom one can with impunity act a part, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>consequently, in order to throw her over, one only needs
to come across something better in her line. Habit or
vow may hold, but I am speaking of the heart's desire,
whose nature it is to fly to the greatest pleasure.</p>

<p>To return to this word <i>natural</i>&mdash;natural and habitual
are two different things. If one takes these words in the
same sense, it is evident that the more sensibility in a
man, the harder it is for him to be natural, since the
influence of <i>habit</i> on his way of being and acting is less
powerful, and he himself is more powerful at each new
event. In the life-story of a cold heart every page is the
same: take him to-day or take him to-morrow, it is always
the same dummy.</p>

<p>A man of sensibility, so soon as his heart is touched,
loses all traces of habit to guide his action; and how can
he follow a path, which he has forgotten all about?</p>

<p>He feels the enormous weight attaching to every word
which he says to the object of his love&mdash;it seems to him as
if a word is to decide his fate. How is he not to look about
for the right word? At any rate, how is he not to have
the feeling that he is trying to say "the right thing"?
And then, there is an end of candour. And so we must
give up our claim to candour, that quality of our being,
which never reflects upon itself. We are the best we
can be, but we feel what we are.</p>

<p>I fancy this brings us to the last degree of <i>naturalness</i>,
to which the most delicate heart can pretend in love.</p>

<p>A man of passion can but cling might and main, as his
only refuge in the storm, to the vow never to change a
jot or tittle of the truth and to read the message of
his heart correctly. If the conversation is lively and
fragmentary, he may hope for some fine moments of
<i>naturalness</i>: otherwise he will only be perfectly natural
in hours when he will be a little less madly in love.</p>

<p>In the presence of the loved one, we hardly retain
<i>naturalness</i> even in our movements, however deeply
such habits are rooted in the muscles. When I gave my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>arm to Léonore, I always felt on the point of stumbling,
and I wondered if I was walking properly. The most
one can do is never to be affected willingly: it is enough
to be convinced that want of <i>naturalness</i> is the greatest
possible disadvantage, and can easily be the source of
the greatest misfortunes. For the heart of the woman,
whom you love, no longer understands your own; you
lose that nervous involuntary movement of sincerity,
which answers the call of sincerity. It means the loss of
every way of touching, I almost said of winning her.
Not that I pretend to deny, that a woman worthy of love
may see her fate in that pretty image of the ivy, which
"dies if it does not cling"&mdash;that is a law of Nature;
but to make your lover's happiness is none the less a step
that will decide your own. To me it seems that a reasonable
woman ought not to give in completely to her lover,
until she can hold out no longer, and the slightest doubt
thrown on the sincerity of your heart gives her there and
then a little strength&mdash;enough at least to delay her defeat
still another day.<a name="FNanchor_7_109" id="FNanchor_7_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_109" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Is it necessary to add that to make all this the last
word in absurdity you have only to apply it to gallant-love?</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>


<p>Always a little doubt to allay&mdash;that is what whets
our appetite every moment, that is what makes
the life of happy love. As it is never separated from fear,
so its pleasures can never tire. The characteristic of this
happiness is its high seriousness.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF CONFIDENCES</span></h3>


<p>There is no form of insolence so swiftly punished
as that which leads you, in passion-love, to take an
intimate friend into your confidence. He knows that, if
what you say is true, you have pleasures a thousand times
greater than he, and that your own make you despise his.</p>

<p>It is far worse between women&mdash;their lot in life being
to inspire a passion, and the <i>confidante</i> having commonly
also displayed her charms for the advantage of the lover.</p>

<p>On the other hand, for anyone a prey to this fever,
there is no moral need more imperative than that of a
friend, before whom to dilate on the fearful doubts
which at every instant beset his soul; for in this terrible
passion, always a thing imagined is a thing existent.</p>

<p>"A great fault in Salviati's character," he writes in
1817, "&mdash;in this point how opposed to Napoleon's!&mdash;is
that when, in the discussion of interests in which passion
is concerned, something is at last morally proved, he
cannot resolve to take that as a fact once and for all
established and as a point to start from. In spite of
himself and greatly to his hurt, he brings it again and
again under discussion." The reason is that, in the field
of ambition, it is easy to be brave. Crystallisation, not
being subjected to the desire of the thing to be won,
helps to fortify our courage; in love it is wholly in
the service of the object against which our courage is
wanted.</p>

<p>A woman may find an unfaithful friend, she also may
find one with nothing to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>A princess of thirty-five,<a name="FNanchor_1_110" id="FNanchor_1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_110" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with nothing to do and dogged
by the need of action, of intrigue, etc. etc., discontented
with a lukewarm lover and yet unable to hope
to sow the seeds of another love, with no use to make
of the energy which is consuming her, with no other
distraction than fits of black humour, can very well
find an occupation, that is to say a pleasure, and a life's
work, in accomplishing the misfortune of a true passion&mdash;passion
which someone has the insolence to feel for
another than herself, while her own lover falls to sleep
at her side.</p>

<p>It is the only case in which hate produces happiness;
the reason being that it procures occupation and work.</p>

<p>Just at first, the pleasure of doing something, and, as
soon as the design is suspected by society, the prick of
doubtful success add a charm to this occupation. Jealousy
of the friend takes the mask of hatred for the lover;
otherwise how would it be possible to hate so madly a
man one has never set eyes on? You cannot recognise
the existence of envy, or, first, you would have to recognise
the existence of merit; and there are flatterers about
you who only hold their place at Court by poking fun
at your good friend.</p>

<p>The faithless <i>confidante</i>, all the while she is indulging
in villainies of the deepest dye, may quite well
think herself solely animated by the desire not to lose
a precious friendship. A woman with nothing to do
tells herself that even friendship languishes in a heart
devoured by love and its mortal anxieties. Friendship
can only hold its own, by the side of love, by the exchange
of confidences; but then what is more odious to envy
than such confidences?</p>

<p>The only kind of confidences well received between
women are those accompanied in all its frankness by a
statement of the case such as this:&mdash;"My dear friend, in
this war, as absurd as it is relentless, which the prejudices,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>brought into vogue by our tyrants, wage upon us, you
help me to-day&mdash;to-morrow it will be my turn."<a name="FNanchor_2_111" id="FNanchor_2_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_111" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Beyond this exception there is another&mdash;that of true
friendship born in childhood and not marred since by
any jealousy...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The confidences of passion-love are only well received
between schoolboys in love with love, and girls eaten up
with unemployed curiosity and tenderness or led on
perhaps by the instinct,<a name="FNanchor_3_112" id="FNanchor_3_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_112" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which whispers to them that
there lies the great business of their life, and that they
cannot look after it too early.</p>

<p>We have all seen little girls of three perform quite
creditably the duties of gallantry. Gallant-love is inflamed,
passion-love chilled by confidences.</p>

<p>Apart from the danger, there is the difficulty of
confidences. In passion-love, things one cannot express
(because the tongue is too gross for such subtleties)
exist none the less; only, as these are things of extreme
delicacy, we are more liable in observing them to make
mistakes.</p>

<p>Also, an observer in a state of emotion is a bad observer;
he won't allow for chance.</p>

<p>Perhaps the only safe way is to make yourself your
own confidant. Write down this evening, under borrowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>names, but with all the characteristic details, the dialogue
you had just now with the woman you care for, and the
difficulty which troubles you. In a week, if it is passion-love,
you will be a different man, and then, rereading
your consultation, you will be able to give a piece of
good advice to yourself.</p>

<p>In male society, as soon as there are more than two
together, and envy might make its appearance, politeness
allows none but physical love to be spoken of&mdash;think of
the end of dinners among men. It is Baffo's sonnets<a name="FNanchor_4_113" id="FNanchor_4_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_113" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> that
are quoted and which give such infinite pleasure; because
each one takes literally the praises and excitement of his
neighbour, who, quite often, merely wants to appear
lively or polite. The sweetly tender words of Petrarch
or French madrigals would be out of place.</p>

among the nobles of the province a succession of hunting parties takes

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF JEALOUSY</span></h3>


<p>When you are in love, as each new object strikes
your eye or your memory, whether crushed in a
gallery and patiently listening to a parliamentary debate,
or galloping to the relief of an outpost under the enemy's
fire, you never fail to add a new perfection to the idea
you have of your mistress, or discover a new means
(which at first seems excellent) of winning her love still
more.</p>

<p>Each step the imagination takes is repaid by a moment
of sweet delight. No wonder that existence, such as this,
takes hold of one.</p>

<p>Directly jealousy comes into existence, this turn of feelings
continues in itself the same, though the effect it is to
produce is contrary. Each perfection that you add to the
crown of your beloved, who now perhaps loves someone
else, far from promising you a heavenly contentment,
thrusts a dagger into your heart. A voice cries out:
"This enchanting pleasure is for my rival to enjoy."<a name="FNanchor_1_114" id="FNanchor_1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_114" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Even the objects which strike you, without producing
this effect, instead of showing you, as before, a new way
of winning her love, cause you to see a new advantage
for your rival.</p>

<p>You meet a pretty woman galloping in the park<a name="FNanchor_2_115" id="FNanchor_2_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_115" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>;
your rival is famous for his fine horses which can do
ten miles in fifty minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>In this state, rage is easily fanned into life; you no
longer remember that in love possession is nothing, enjoyment
everything. You exaggerate the happiness of
your rival, exaggerate the insolence happiness produces
in him, and you come at last to the limit of tortures,
that is to say to the extremest unhappiness, poisoned still
further by a lingering hope.</p>

<p>The only remedy is, perhaps, to observe your rival's
happiness at close quarters. Often you will see him fall
peacefully asleep in the same <i>salon</i> as the woman, for
whom your heart stops beating, at the mere sight of a
hat like hers some way off in the street.</p>

<p>To wake him up you have only to show your jealousy.
You may have, perhaps, the pleasure of teaching him the
price of the woman who prefers him to you, and he will
owe to you the love he will learn to have for her.</p>

<p>Face to face with a rival there is no mean&mdash;you must
either banter with him in the most off-hand way you can,
or frighten him.</p>

<p>Jealousy being the greatest of all evils, endangering one's
life will be found an agreeable diversion. For then not
all our fancies are embittered and blackened (by the
mechanism explained above)&mdash;sometimes it is possible to
imagine that one kills this rival.</p>

<p>According to this principle, that it is never right to
add to the enemy's forces, you must hide your love from
your rival, and, under some pretext of vanity as far as
possible removed from love, say to him very quietly, with
all possible politeness, and in the calmest, simplest tone:
"Sir, I cannot think why the public sees good to make
little So-and-so mine; people are even good enough to
believe that I am in love with her. As for you, if you
want her, I would hand her over with all my heart, if
unhappily there were not the risk of placing myself into
a ridiculous position. In six months, take her as much as
ever you like, but at the present moment, honour, such
as people attach (why, I don't know) to these things,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>forces me to tell you, to my great regret, that, if by
chance you have not the justice to wait till your turn
comes round, one of us must die."</p>

<p>Your rival is very likely a man without much passion,
and perhaps a man of much prudence, who once convinced
of your resolution, will make haste to yield you
the woman in question, provided he can find any decent
pretext. For that reason you must give a gay tone to
your challenge, and keep the whole move hidden with
the greatest secrecy.</p>

<p>What makes the pain of jealousy so sharp is that vanity
cannot help you to bear it. But, according to the plan
I have spoken of, your vanity has something to feed on;
you can respect yourself for bravery, even if you are
reduced to despising your powers of pleasing.</p>

<p>If you would rather not carry things to such tragic
lengths, you must pack up and go miles away, and keep a
chorus-girl, whose charms people will think have arrested
you in your flight.</p>

<p>Your rival has only to be an ordinary person and he
will think you are consoled.</p>

<p>Very often the best way is to wait without flinching,
while he wears himself out in the eyes of the loved one
through his own stupidity. For, except in a serious
passion formed little by little and in early youth, a clever
woman does not love an undistinguished man for long.<a name="FNanchor_3_116" id="FNanchor_3_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_116" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
In the case of jealousy after intimate intercourse, there
must follow also apparent indifference or real inconstancy.
Plenty of women, offended with a lover whom
they still love, form an attachment with the man, of
whom he has shown himself jealous, and the play becomes
a reality.<a name="FNanchor_4_117" id="FNanchor_4_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_117" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I have gone into some detail, because in these moments
of jealousy one often loses one's head. Counsels, made
in writing a long time ago, are useful, and, the essential
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>thing being to feign calmness, it is not out of place in a
philosophical piece of writing, to adopt that tone.</p>

<p>As your adversaries' power over you consists in taking
away from you or making you hope for things, whose
whole worth consists in your passion for them, once
manage to make them think you are indifferent, and suddenly
they are without a weapon.</p>

<p>If you have no active course to take, but can distract
yourself in looking for consolation, you will find some
pleasure in reading <i>Othello</i>; it will make you doubt the
most conclusive appearances. You will feast your eyes
on these words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Seem to the jealous confirmations strong<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As proofs from Holy Writ.    (<i>Othello</i>, Act III.)<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is my experience that the sight of a fine sea is consoling.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The morning which had arisen calm and bright gave a pleasant
effect to the waste mountain view, which was seen from the
castle on looking to the landward, and the glorious ocean crisped
with a thousand rippling waves of silver extended on the other
side in awful, yet complacent majesty to the verge of the horizon.
With such scenes of calm sublimity the human heart sympathises
even in its most disturbed moods, and deeds of honour and virtue
are inspired by their majestic influence. (<i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>,
Chap. VII.)</p></blockquote>

<p>I find this written by Salviati:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>July 20th</i>, 1818.&mdash;I often&mdash;and I think unreasonably&mdash;apply to
life as a whole the feelings of a man of ambition or a good citizen,
if he finds himself set in battle to guard the baggage or in any
other post without danger or action. I should have felt regret
at forty to have passed the age of loving without deep passion.
I should have had that bitter and humiliating displeasure, to
have found out too late that I had been fool enough to let life
pass, without living.</p>

<p>Yesterday I spent three hours with the woman I love and a
rival, whom she wants to make me think she favours. Certainly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>there were moments of bitterness, in watching her lovely eyes
fixed on him, and, on my departure, there were wild transports
from utter misery to hope. But what changes, what sudden
lights, what swift thoughts, and, in spite of the apparent happiness
of my rival, with what pride and what delight my love felt itself
superior to his! I went away saying to myself: The most vile fear
would bleach those cheeks at the least of the sacrifices, which my
love would make for the fun of it, nay, with delight&mdash;for example,
to put this hand into a hat and draw one of these two lots: "Be
loved by her," the other&mdash;"Die on the spot." And this feeling
in me is so much second nature, that it did not prevent me being
amiable and talkative.</p>

<p>If someone had told me all that two years ago, I should have
laughed.</p></blockquote>

<p>I find in the <i>Travels to the Source of the Missouri River
... in</i> 1804&ndash;6 of Captains Lewis and Clarke (p. 215):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Ricaras are poor and generous; we stayed some time in
three of their villages. Their women are more beautiful than
those of the other tribes we came across; they are also not in
the least inclined to let their lover languish. We found a new
example of the truth that you only have to travel to find out
that there is variety everywhere. Among the Ricaras, for a woman
to grant her favours without the consent of her husband or her
brother, gives great offence. But then the brothers and the
husband are only too delighted to have the opportunity of showing
this courtesy to their friends.</p>

<p>There was a negro in our crew; he created a great sensation
among a people who had never seen a man of his colour before.
He was soon a favourite with the fair sex, and we noticed that the
husbands, instead of being jealous, were overjoyed to see him
come to visit them. The funny part was that the interior of the
huts was so narrow that everything was visible.<a name="FNanchor_5_118" id="FNanchor_5_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_118" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>
I know quite well that such academies exist&mdash;but apparently regulated
in a way worthy of our academies in Europe. (Memoir and Discussion
on the Zodiac of Denderah at the Académie des Sciences of Paris, 1821.)
I notice that the academy of, I fancy, Massachusetts wisely charges a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>member of the clergy (Mr. Jarvis) to make a report on the religion of the
savage. The priest, of course, refutes energetically an impious Frenchman,
called Volney. According to the priest, the savage has the most
exact and noble ideas of the Divinity, etc. If he lived in England, such
a report would bring the worthy academician a preferment of three or
four hundred pounds and the protection of all the noble lords in the
county. But in America! For the rest, the absurdity of this academy
reminds me of the free Americans, who set the greatest store on seeing
fine coats-of-arms painted on the panels of their carriages; what upsets
them is that, through their carriage-painter's want of instruction, the
blazoning is often wrong.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF JEALOUSY&mdash;(continued)</span></h3>


<p>Now for the woman suspected of inconstancy!</p>

<p>She leaves you, because you have discouraged
crystallisation, but it is possible that in her heart you
have habit to plead for you.</p>

<p>She leaves you, because she is too sure of you. You
have killed fear, and there is nothing left to give birth
to the little doubts of happy love. Just make her uneasy,
and, above all, beware of the absurdity of protestations!</p>

<p>During all the time you have lived in touch with her,
you will doubtless have discovered what woman, in
society or outside it, she is most jealous or most afraid
of. Pay court to that woman, but so far from blazoning
it about, do your best to keep it secret, and do your best
sincerely; trust to the eyes of anger to see everything
and feel everything. The strong aversion you will have
felt for several months to all women ought to make this
easy.<a name="FNanchor_1_119" id="FNanchor_1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_119" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Remember that in the position you are in, everything
is spoiled by a show of passion: avoid seeing
much of the woman you love, and drink champagne
with the wits.</p>

<p>In order to judge of your mistress' love, remember:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The more physical pleasure counts for in the basis
of her love and in what formerly determined her to
yield, the more prone it is to inconstancy, and, still
more, to infidelity. This applies especially to love in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>which crystallisation has been favoured by the fire of
sweet seventeen.</p>

<p>2. Two people in love are hardly ever equally in
love:<a name="FNanchor_2_120" id="FNanchor_2_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_120" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> passion-love has its phases, during which now one,
now the other is more impassioned. Often, too, it is
merely gallantry or vain love which responds to passion-love,
and it is generally the woman who is carried away
by passion. But whatever the love may be that either of
them feels, directly one of them is jealous, he insists on
the other fulfilling all the conditions of passion-love;
vanity pretends to all the claims of a heart that feels.</p>

<p>Furthermore, nothing wearies gallant-love like passion-love
from the other side.</p>

<p>Often a clever man, paying court to a woman, just sets
her thinking of love in a sentimental frame of mind.
She receives this clever man kindly for giving her this
pleasure&mdash;he conceives hopes.</p>

<p>But one fine day that woman meets the man, who
makes her feel what the other has described.</p>

<p>I do not know what are the effects of a man's jealousy
on the heart of the woman he loves. Displayed by an
admirer who wearies her, jealousy must inspire a supreme
disgust, and it may even turn to hatred, if the man he is
jealous of is nicer than the jealous one; for we want
jealousy, said Madame de Coulanges, only from those of
whom we could be jealous.</p>

<p>If the jealous one is liked, but has no real claims, his
jealousy may offend that feminine pride so hard to keep
in humour or even to recognise. Jealousy may please
women of pride, as a new way of showing them their
power.</p>

<p>Jealousy can please as a new way of giving proof of
love. It can also offend the modesty of a woman who is
over-refined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>It can please as a sign of the lover's hot blood&mdash;<i>ferrum
est quod amant</i>. But note that it is hot blood they love,
and not courage <i>à la</i> Turenne, which is quite compatible
with a cold heart.</p>

<p>One of the consequences of crystallisation is that a
woman can never say "yes" to the lover, to whom she
has been unfaithful, if she ever means to make anything of
him.</p>

<p>Such is the pleasure of continuing to enjoy the perfect
image we have formed of the object of our attachment,
that until that fatal "yes"&mdash;</p>

<p>Everyone in France knows the anecdote of Mademoiselle
de Sommery, who, caught in flagrant delict by
her lover, flatly denied the fact. On his protesting, she
replied: "Very well, I see you don't love me any
more: you believe what you see before what I tell you."</p>

<p>To make it up with an idol of a mistress, who has
been unfaithful, is to set yourself to undo with the point
of a dagger a crystallisation incessantly forming afresh.
Love has got to die, and your heart will feel the cruel
pang of every stage in its agony.</p>

<p>It is one of the saddest dispositions of this passion and
of life. You must be strong enough to make it up only
as friends.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ROXANA</span></h3>


<p>As for women's jealousy&mdash;they are suspicious, they
have infinitely more at stake than we, they have
made a greater sacrifice to love, have far fewer means
of distraction and, above all, far fewer means of keeping
a check on their lover's actions. A woman feels herself
degraded by jealousy; she thinks her lover is laughing
at her, or, still worse, making fun of her tenderest transports.
Cruelty must tempt her&mdash;and yet, legally, she cannot
kill her rival!</p>

<p>For women, jealousy must be a still more abominable
evil than it is for men. It is the last degree of impotent
rage and self-contempt<a name="FNanchor_1_122" id="FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> which a heart can bear without
breaking.</p>

<p>I know no other remedy for so cruel an evil, than the
death of the one who is the cause of it or of the one who
suffers. An example of French jealousy is the story of
Madame de la Pommeraie in <i>Jacques le Fataliste</i><span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_19" id="TNanch_19"></a><a href="#TN_19">(19)</a></span>.</p>

<p>La Rochefoucauld says: "We are ashamed of owning
we are jealous, but pride ourselves on having been and
of being capable of jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Poor woman dares not
own even to having suffered this torture, so much ridicule
does it bring upon her. So painful a wound can never
quite heal up.</p>

<p>If cold reason could be unfolded before the fire of
imagination with the merest shade of success, I would say
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>to those wretched women, who are unhappy from
jealousy: "There is a great difference between infidelity
in man and in you. In you, the importance of the act is
partly direct, partly symbolic. But, as an effect of the
education of our military schools, it is in man the symbol
of nothing at all. On the contrary, in women, through
the effect of modesty, it is the most decisive of all the
symbols of devotion. Bad habit makes it almost a
necessity to men. During all our early years, the
example set by the so-called 'bloods' makes us set all
our pride on the number of successes of this kind&mdash;as
the one and only proof of our worth. For you, your
education acts in exactly the opposite direction."</p>

<p>As for the value of an action as symbol&mdash;in a moment
of anger I upset a table on to the foot of my neighbour;
that gives him the devil of a pain, but can quite easily be
fixed up&mdash;or again, I make as if to give him a slap in the
face....</p>

<p>The difference between infidelity in the two sexes is
so real, that a woman of passion may pardon it, while
for a man that is impossible.</p>

<p>Here we have a decisive ordeal to show the difference
between passion-love and love from pique: infidelity
in women all but kills the former and doubles the force
of the latter.</p>

<p>Haughty women disguise their jealousy from pride.
They will spend long and dreary evenings in silence with
the man whom they adore, and whom they tremble to lose,
making themselves consciously disagreeable in his eyes.
This must be one of the greatest possible tortures, and is
certainly one of the most fruitful sources of unhappiness
in love. In order to cure these women, who merit so
well all our respect, it needs on the man's side a strong
and out-of-the-way line of action&mdash;but, mind, he
must not seem to notice what is going on&mdash;for example,
a long journey with them undertaken at a twenty-four
hours' notice.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF SELF-ESTEEM PIQUED<a name="FNanchor_1_124" id="FNanchor_1_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_124" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h3>


<p>Pique is a manifestation of vanity; I do not want
my antagonist to go higher than myself and <i>I take
that antagonist himself as judge of my worth</i>. I want to
produce an effect on his heart. It is this that carries us
so far beyond all reasonable limits.</p>

<p>Sometimes, to justify our own extravagance, we go
so far as to tell ourselves that this rival has a mind to
dupe us.</p>

<p>Pique, being an infirmity of honour, is far more common
in monarchies; it must, surely, be exceedingly rare in
countries, where the habit is rampant of valuing things
according to their utility&mdash;for example, in the United
States.</p>

<p>Every man, and a Frenchman sooner than any other,
loathes being taken for a dupe; and yet the lightness of
the French character under the old monarchic <i>régime</i><a name="FNanchor_2_125" id="FNanchor_2_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_125" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
prevented pique from working great havoc beyond the
domains of gallantry and gallant-love. Pique has produced
serious tragedies only in monarchies, where,
through the climate, the shade of character is darker
(Portugal, Piedmont).</p>

<p>The provincial in France forms a ludicrous idea of
what is considered a gentleman in good society&mdash;and then
he takes cover behind his model, and waits there all his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>life to see that no one trespasses. And so good-bye
naturalness! He is always in a state of pique, a mania
which gives a laughable character even to his love affairs.
This enviousness is what makes it most unbearable to
live in small towns, and one should remind oneself of
this, when one admires the picturesque situation of any
of them. The most generous and noble emotions are
there paralysed by contact with all that is most low in
the products of civilisation. In order to put the finishing
touch to their awfulness, these bourgeois talk of nothing
but the corruption of great cities.<a name="FNanchor_3_126" id="FNanchor_3_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_126" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Pique cannot exist in passion-love; it is feminine
pride. "If I let my lover treat me badly, he will despise
me and no longer be able to love me." It may also
be jealousy in all its fury.</p>

<p>Jealousy desires the death of the object it fears. The
man in a state of pique is miles away from that&mdash;he
wants his enemy to live, and, above all, be witness of his
triumph.</p>

<p>He would be sorry to see his rival renounce the struggle,
for the fellow may have the insolence to say in the depth
of his heart: "If I had persevered in my original object,
I should have outdone him."</p>

<p>With pique, there is no interest in the apparent purpose&mdash;the
point of everything is victory. This is well
brought out in the love affairs of chorus-girls; take away
the rival, and the boasted passion, which threatened
suicide from the fifth-floor window, instantly subsides.</p>

<p>Love from pique, contrary to passion-love, passes in
a moment; it is enough for the antagonist by an irrevocable
step to own that he renounces the struggle. I
hesitate, however, to advance this maxim, having only
one example, and that leaves doubts in my mind. Here
are the facts&mdash;the reader will judge. Dona Diana is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>young person of twenty-three, daughter of one of the
richest and proudest citizens of Seville. She is beautiful,
without any doubt, but of a peculiar type of beauty, and is
credited with ever so much wit and still more pride. She
was passionately in love, to all appearances at least, with a
young officer, with whom her family would have nothing
to do. The officer left for America with Morillo, and
they corresponded continuously. One day in the midst
of a lot of people, assembled round the mother of Dona
Diana, a fool announced the death of the charming
officer. All eyes are turned upon Dona Diana; Dona
Diana says nothing but these words: "What a pity&mdash;so
young."</p>

<p>Just that day we had been reading a play of old
Massinger, which ends tragically, but in which the
heroine takes the death of her lover with this apparent
tranquillity. I saw the mother shudder in spite of her
pride and dislike; the father went out of the room to
hide his joy. In the midst of this scene and the dismay
of all present, who were making eyes at the fool who
had told the story, Dona Diana, the only one at ease,
proceeded with the conversation, as if nothing had happened.
Her mother, in apprehension, set her maid
to watch her, but nothing seemed to be altered in her
behaviour.</p>

<p>Two years later, a very fine young man paid his attentions
to her. This time again, and, still for the same
reason, Dona Diana's parents violently opposed the
marriage, because the aspirant was not of noble birth.
She herself declared it should take place. A state of
pique ensues between the daughter's sense of honour
and the father's. The young man is forbidden the house.
Dona Diana is no longer taken to the country and hardly
ever to church. With scrupulous care, every means of
meeting her lover is taken from her. He disguises
himself and sees her secretly at long intervals. She
becomes more and more resolute, and refuses the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>brilliant matches, even a title and a great establishment
at the Court of Ferdinand VII. The whole town is
talking of the misfortunes of the two lovers and of their
heroic constancy. At last the majority of Dona Diana
draws near. She gives her father to understand that she
means to make use of her right of disposing of her
own hand. The family, driven back on its last resources,
opens negotiations for the marriage. When it is half
concluded, at an official meeting of the two families, the
young man, after six years' constancy, refuses Dona Diana.<a name="FNanchor_4_127" id="FNanchor_4_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_127" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later no trace of anything&mdash;she
was consoled. Did she love from pique? Or are we
face to face with a great soul, that disclaims to parade
its sorrow before the eyes of the world?</p>

<p>In passion-love satisfaction, if I can call it such, is often
only to be won by piquing the loved one's self-esteem.
Then, in appearance, the lover realises all that can be
desired; complaints would be ridiculous and seem senseless.
He cannot speak of his misfortune, and yet how constantly
he knows and feels its prick! Its traces are inwoven,
so to speak, with circumstances, the most flattering and
the most fit to awaken illusions of enchantment. This
misfortune rears its monstrous head at the tenderest
moments, as if to taunt the lover and make him feel, at one
and the same instant, all the delight of being loved by
the charming and unfeeling creature in his arms, and
the impossibility of this delight being his. Perhaps after
jealousy, this is the cruellest unhappiness.</p>

<p>The story is still fresh in a certain large town<a name="FNanchor_5_128" id="FNanchor_5_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_128" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of a
man of soft and gentle nature, who was carried away by
a rage of this kind to spill the blood of his mistress, who
only loved him from pique against her sister. He arranged
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>with her, one evening, to come for a row on the sea by
themselves, in a pretty little boat he had devised himself.
Once well out to sea, he touches a spring, the boat divides
and disappears for ever.</p>

<p>I have seen a man of sixty set out to keep an actress,
the most capricious, irresponsible, delightful and wonderful
on the London stage&mdash;Miss Cornel.</p>

<p>"And you expect that she'll be faithful?" people
asked him.</p>

<p>"Not in the least. But she'll be in love with me&mdash;perhaps
madly in love."</p>

<p>And for a whole year she did love him&mdash;often to
distraction. For three whole months together she
never even gave him subject for complaint. He had
put a state of pique, disgraceful in many ways, between
his mistress and his daughter.</p>

<p>Pique wins the day in gallant-love, being its very life
and blood. It is the ordeal best fitted to differentiate
between gallant-love and passion-love. There is an old
maxim of war, given to young fellows new to their regiment,
that if you are billeted on a house, where there
are two sisters, and you want to have one, you must
pay your attentions to the other. To win the majority
of Spanish women, who are still young and ready for
love affairs, it is enough to give out, seriously and modestly,
that you have no feelings whatever for the lady of the
house. I have this useful maxim from dear General
Lassale. This is the most dangerous way of attacking
passion-love.</p>

<p>Piqued self-esteem is the bond which ties the happiest
marriages, after those formed by love. Many husbands
make sure of their wives' love for many years, by taking
up with some little woman a couple of months after their
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_6_129" id="FNanchor_6_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_129" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> In this way the habit is engendered of thinking
only of one man, and family ties succeed in making
the habit invincible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>If in the past century at the Court of Louis XV a
great lady (Madame de Choiseul) was seen to worship
her husband,<a name="FNanchor_7_130" id="FNanchor_7_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_130" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> the reason is that he seemed to take a
keen interest in her sister, the Duchesse de Grammont.</p>

<p>The most neglected mistress, once she makes us see
that she prefers another man, robs us of our peace and
afflicts our heart with all the semblance of passion.</p>

<p>The courage of an Italian is an access of rage; the
courage of a German a moment of intoxication; that of
a Spaniard an outburst of pride. If there were a nation,
in which courage were generally a matter of piqued self-esteem
between the soldiers of each company and the
regiments of each division, in the case of a rout there
would be no support, and consequently there would be
no means of rallying the armies of such a nation. To
foresee the danger and try to remedy it, would be the
greatest of all absurdities with such conceited runaways.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is enough to have opened any single description of a voyage
among the savages of North America," says one of the most
delightful philosophers of France,<a name="FNanchor_8_131" id="FNanchor_8_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_131" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> "to know that the ordinary
fate of prisoners of war is not only to be burnt alive and eaten,
but first to be bound to a stake near a flaming bonfire and to be
tortured there for several hours, by all the most ferocious and
refined devices that fury can imagine. Read what travellers,
who have witnessed these fearful scenes, tell of the cannibal joy
of the assistants, above all, of the fury of the women and children,
and of their gruesome delight in this competition of cruelty.
See also what they add about the heroic firmness and immutable
self-possession of the prisoner, who not only gives no sign of pain,
but taunts and defies his torturers, by all that pride can make
most haughty, irony most bitter, and sarcasm most insulting&mdash;singing
his own glorious deeds, going through the number of the
relations and friends of the onlookers whom he has killed, detailing
the sufferings he has inflicted on them, and accusing all that
stand around him of cowardice, timidity and ignorance of the
methods of torture; until falling limb from limb, devoured alive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>under his own eyes by enemies drunk with fury, he gasps out his
last whisper and his last insult together with his life's breath.<a name="FNanchor_9_132" id="FNanchor_9_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_132" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> All
this would be beyond belief in civilised nations, will look like
fable to the most fearless captains of our grenadiers, and will
one day be brought into doubt by posterity."</p></blockquote>

<p>This physiological phenomenon is closely connected
with a particular moral state in the prisoner, which constitutes,
between him on the one side and all his torturers
on the other, a combat of self-esteem&mdash;of vanity against
vanity, as to who can hold out longer.</p>

<p>Our brave military doctors have often observed that
wounded soldiers, who, in a calm state of mind and senses,
would have shrieked out, during certain operations, display,
on the contrary, only calmness and heroism, if they
are prepared for it in a certain manner. It is a matter
of piquing their sense of honour; you have to pretend,
first in a roundabout way, and then with irritating
persistence, that it is beyond their present power to bear
the operation without shrieking.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF QUARRELSOME LOVE</span></h3>

<p>It is of two kinds:</p>

<ol>
<li>In which the originator of the quarrel loves.</li>
<li>In which he does not love.</li>
</ol>

<p>If one of the lovers is too superior in advantages
which both value, the love of the other must die; for
sooner or later comes the fear of contempt, to cut short
crystallisation.</p>

<p>Nothing is so odious to the mediocre as mental superiority.
There lies the source of hatred in the world of
to-day, and if we do not have to thank this principle for
desperate enmities, it is solely due to the fact that the
people it comes between are not forced to live together.
What then of love? For here, everything being natural,
especially on the part of the superior being, superiority
is not masked by any social precaution.</p>

<p>For the passion to be able to survive, the inferior
must ill-treat the other party; otherwise the latter could
not shut a window, without the other taking offence.</p>

<p>As for the superior party, he deludes himself: the
love he feels is beyond the reach of danger, and, besides,
almost all the weaknesses in that which we love, make it
only the dearer to us.</p>

<p>In point of duration, directly after passion-love reciprocated
between people on the same level, one must
put quarrelsome love, in which the quarreller does not
love. Examples of this are to be found in the anecdotes,
relative to the Duchesse de Berri (Memoirs of Duclos).</p>

<p>Partaking, as it does, of the nature of set habits, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>are rooted in the prosaic and egoistic side of life and
follow man inseparably to the grave, this love can last
longer than passion-love itself. But it is no longer love,
it is a habit engendered by love, which has nothing of
that passion but memories and physical pleasure. This
habit necessarily presupposes a less noble kind of being.
Each day a little scene is got ready&mdash;"Will he make a
fuss?"&mdash;which occupies the imagination, just as, in
passion-love, every day a new proof of affection had to
be found. See the anecdotes about Madame d'Houdetot
and Saint-Lambert.<a name="FNanchor_1_133" id="FNanchor_1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_133" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is possible that pride refuses to get used to this
kind of occupation; in which case, after some stormy
months, pride kills love. But we see the nobler passion
make a long resistance before giving in. The little
quarrels of happy love foster a long time the illusion of
a heart that still loves and sees itself badly treated.
Some tender reconciliations may make the transition
more bearable. A woman excuses the man she has deeply
loved, on the score of a secret sorrow or a blow to his
prospects. At last she grows used to being scolded.
Where, really, outside passion-love, outside gambling or
the possession of power,<a name="FNanchor_2_134" id="FNanchor_2_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_134" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> can you find any other unfailing
entertainment to be compared with it for liveliness?
If the scolder happens to die, the victim who survives
proves inconsolable. This is the principle which forms
the bond of many middle-class marriages; the scolded
can listen to his own voice all day long talking of his
favourite subject.</p>

<p>There is a false kind of quarrelsome love. I took from
the letters of a woman of extraordinary brilliance this in
Chapter XXXIII:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Always a little doubt to allay&mdash;that is what whets our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>appetite in passion-love every moment.... As it is
never separated from fear, so its pleasures can never tire."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With rough and ill-mannered people, or those with a
very violent nature, this little doubt to calm, this faint
misgiving shows itself in the form of a quarrel.</p>

<p>If the loved one has not the extreme susceptibility,
which comes of a careful education, she may find that
love of this kind has more life in it, and consequently is
more enjoyable. Even with all the refinement in the
world, it is hard not to love "your savage" all the more,
if you see him the first to suffer for his transports. What
Lord Mortimer thinks back on, perhaps, with most regret
for his lost mistress, are the candlesticks she threw at his
head. And, really, if pride forgives and permits such
sensations, it must also be allowed that they do wage
implacable warfare upon boredom&mdash;that arch-enemy of
the happy!</p>

<p>Saint-Simon, the one historian France has had,
says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>After several passing fancies, the Duchesse de Berri had fallen
in love, in real earnest, with Riom, cadet of the house of d'Aydie,
son of a sister of Madame de Biron. He had neither looks nor
sense: a stout, short youth, with a puffy white face, who with
all his spots looked like one big abscess&mdash;though, true, he had fine
teeth. He had no idea of having inspired a passion, which in less
than no time went beyond all limits and lasted ever after, without,
indeed, preventing passing fancies and cross-attachments. He
had little property, and many brothers and sisters who had no
more. M. and Madame de Pons, lady-in-waiting to the Duchesse
de Berri, were related to them and of the same province, and they
sent for the young man, who was a lieutenant in the dragoons,
to see what could be made of him. He had scarcely arrived before
the Duchess's weakness for him became public and Riom was master
of the Luxembourg.</p>

<p>M. de Lauzun, whose grand-nephew he was, laughed in his
sleeve; he was delighted to see in Riom a reincarnation at the
Luxembourg of himself from the time of Mademoiselle. He
gave Riom instructions which were listened to by him, as befitted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>a mild and naturally polite and respectful young fellow, well
behaved and straightforward. But before long Riom began to feel
the power of his own charms, which could only captivate the incomprehensible
humour of this princess. Without abusing his power
with others, he made himself liked by everyone, but he treated
his duchess as M. de Lauzun had treated Mademoiselle. He was
soon dressed in the richest laces, the richest suits, furnished with
money, buckles, jewels. He made himself an object of admiration
and took a delight in making the princess jealous or pretending to
be jealous himself&mdash;bringing her often to tears. Little by little
he reduced her to the state of doing nothing without his permission,
not even in matters of indifference. At one time, ready to go
out to the Opera, he made her stay at home; at another he made
her go against her will. He forced her to do favours to ladies she
disliked, or of whom she was jealous, and to injure people she
liked, or of whom he pretended to be jealous. Even as far as
dress, she was not allowed the smallest liberty. He used to amuse
himself by making her have her hair done all over again, or have
her dress changed when she was completely ready&mdash;and this happened
so often and so publicly, that he had accustomed her to
take in the evening his orders for dress and occupation for the
next day. The next day he would change it all and make the
princess cry still more. At last she came to sending him messages
by trusted valets&mdash;for he lived in the Luxembourg almost from
the day of his arrival&mdash;and the messages had often to be repeated
during her toilet for her to know what ribbons to wear and about
her frock and other details of dress; and nearly always he made
her wear what she disliked. If sometimes she gave herself some
liberty in the smallest matter without leave, he treated her like a
servant, and often her tears lasted several days.</p>

<p>This haughty princess, who was so fond of display and indulging
her boundless pride, could bring herself so low as to partake of
obscene parties with him and unmentionable people&mdash;she with
whom no one could dine unless he were prince of the blood. The
Jesuit Riglet, whom she as a child had known, and who had
brought her up, was admitted to these private meals, without
feeling ashamed himself or the Duchess being embarrassed.
Madame de Mouchy was admitted into the secret of all these
strange events; she and Riom summoned the company and chose
the days. This lady was the peacemaker between the two lovers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>and the whole of this existence was a matter of general knowledge
at the Luxembourg. Riom was there looked to, as the centre
of everything, while on his side he was careful to live on good
terms with all, honouring them with a show of respect, which he
refused in public only to his princess. Before everybody he would
give her curt answers, which would make the whole company
lower their eyes and bring blushes to the cheeks of the Duchess,
who put no constraint upon her idolatry of him."</p></blockquote>

<p>Riom was a sovereign remedy, for the Duchess, against
the monotony of life.</p>

<p>A famous woman said once off-hand to General Bonaparte,
then a young hero covered with glory and with no
crimes against liberty on his conscience: "General, a
woman could only be a wife or a sister to you." The
hero did not understand the compliment, which the
world has made up for with some pretty slanders.</p>

<p>The women, of whom we are speaking, like to be despised
by their lover, whom they only love in his cruelty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">(Part II)<br />

REMEDIES AGAINST LOVE</span></h3>

<p>The leap of Leucas was a fine image of antiquity. It is
true, the remedy of love is almost impossible. A danger
is needed to call man's attention back sharply to look to
his own preservation.<a name="FNanchor_1_135" id="FNanchor_1_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_135" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But that is not all. What is harder
to realise&mdash;a pressing danger must continue, and one that
can only be averted with care, in order that the habit of
thinking of his own preservation may have time to take
root. I can see nothing that will do but a storm of sixteen
days, like that in <i>Don Juan</i><a name="FNanchor_2_136" id="FNanchor_2_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_136" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or the shipwreck of
M. Cochelet among the Moors. Otherwise, one gets
soon used to the peril, and even drops back into thoughts
of the loved one with still more charm&mdash;when reconnoitring
at twenty yards' range from the enemy.</p>

<p>We have repeated over and over again that the love of
a man, who loves well, delights in and vibrates to every
movement of his imagination, and that there is nothing
in nature which does not speak to him of the object of
his love. Well, this delight and this vibration form a
most interesting occupation, next to which all others
pale.</p>

<p>A friend who wants to work the cure of the patient,
must, first of all, be always on the side of the woman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>the patient is in love with&mdash;and all friends, with more
zeal than sense, are sure to do exactly the opposite.</p>

<p>It is attacking with forces too absurdly inferior that
combination of sweet illusions, which earlier we called
crystallisation.<a name="FNanchor_3_137" id="FNanchor_3_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_137" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The <i>friend in need</i> should not forget this fact, that, if
there is an absurdity to be believed, as the lover has
either to swallow it or renounce everything which
holds him to life, he will swallow it. With all the cleverness
in the world, he will deny in his mistress the most
palpable vices and the most villainous infidelities. This
is how, in passion-love, everything is forgiven after a
little.</p>

<p>In the case of reasonable and cold characters, for the
lover to swallow the vices of a mistress, he must only
find them out after several months of passion.<a name="FNanchor_4_138" id="FNanchor_4_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_138" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Far from trying bluntly and openly to distract the
lover, the <i>friend in need</i> ought to tire him with talking
of his love and his mistress, and at the same time manage
that a host of little events force themselves upon his
notice. Even if travel isolates,<a name="FNanchor_5_139" id="FNanchor_5_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_139" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> it is still no remedy,
and in fact nothing recalls so tenderly the object of our
love as change of scene. It was in the midst of the
brilliant Paris <i>salons</i>, next to women with the greatest
reputation for charm, that I was most in love with my
poor mistress, solitary and sad in her little room in the
depth of the Romagna.<a name="FNanchor_6_140" id="FNanchor_6_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_140" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>I looked at the superb clock in the brilliant <i>salon</i>,
where I was exiled, for the hour she goes out on foot,
even in the rain, to call on her friend. Trying to forget
her, I have found that change of scene is the source of
memories of one's love, less vivid but far more heavenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>than those one goes in search for in places, where once
upon a time one met her.</p>

<p>In order that absence may prove useful, the <i>friend in
need</i> must be always at hand, and suggest to the lover's
mind all possible reflections on the history of his love,
trying to make these reflections tiresome through their
length and importunity. In this way he gives them the
appearance of commonplaces. For example, tender sentimental
talk after a dinner enlivened with good wine.</p>

<p>It is hard to forget a woman, with whom one has been
happy; for, remember, that there are certain moments
the imagination can never be tired of evoking and
beautifying.</p>

<p>I leave out all mention of pride, cruel but sovereign
remedy, which, however, is not to be applied to sensitive
souls.</p>

<p>The first scenes of Shakespeare's <i>Romeo</i> form an admirable
picture; there is so vast a gap between the man
who says sorrowfully to himself: "She hath forsworn to
love," and he who cries out in the height of happiness:
"Come what sorrow can!"</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">(Part III)</span></h3>

<p class="quotl">Her passion will die like a lamp for want of what the flame should
feed upon. (<i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>, II, Chap. VI.)]</p>

<p>The <i>friend in need</i> must beware of faulty reasoning&mdash;for
example, of talking about ingratitude. You
are giving new life to crystallisation, by procuring it a
victory and a new enjoyment.</p>

<p>In love there is no such thing as ingratitude; the actual
pleasure always repays, and more than repays, sacrifices
that seem the greatest. In love no other crime but want
of honesty seems to me possible: one should be scrupulous
as to the state of one's heart.</p>

<p>The <i>friend in need</i> has only to attack fair and square,
for the lover to answer:&mdash;</p>

<p>"To be in love, even while enraged with the loved
one, is nothing less, to bring myself down to your £ s. d.
style, than having a ticket in a lottery, in which the prize
is a thousand miles above all that you can offer me, in
your world of indifference and selfish interests. One must
have plenty of vanity&mdash;and precious petty vanity&mdash;to be
happy, because people receive you well. I do not blame
men for going on like this, in their world, but in the love
of Léonore I found a world where everything was heavenly,
tender and generous. The most lofty and almost incredible
virtue of your world counted, between her and
me, only as any ordinary and everyday virtue. Let me
at all events dream of the happiness of passing my life
close to such a creature. Although I understand that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>slander has ruined me, and that I have nothing to hope
for, at least I shall make her the sacrifice of my vengeance."</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to put a stop to love except in
its first stages. Besides a prompt departure, and the
forced distractions of society (as in the case of the Comtesse
Kalember), there are several other little ruses,
which the <i>friend in need</i> can bring into play. For example,
he can bring to your notice, as if by chance, the
fact that the woman you love, quite outside the disputed
area, does not even observe towards you the same amount
of politeness and respect, with which she honours your
rival. The smallest details are enough; for in love
everything is a sign. For example, she does not take
your arm to go up to her box. This sort of nonsense,
taken tragically by a passionate heart, couples a pang of
humiliation to every judgment formed by crystallisation,
poisons the source of love and may destroy it.</p>

<p>One way against the woman, who is behaving badly
to our friend, is to bring her under suspicion of some
absurd physical defect, impossible to verify. If it were
possible for the lover to verify the calumny, and even if
he found it substantiated, it would be disqualified by his
imagination, and soon have no place with him at all.
It is only imagination itself which can resist imagination:
Henry III knew that very well when he scoffed at the
famous Duchesse de Montpensier<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_22" id="TNanch_22"></a><a href="#TN_22">(22)</a></span>.</p>

<p>Hence it is the imagination you must look to&mdash;above
all, in a girl whom you want to keep safe from love.
And the less her spirit has of the common stuff, the
more noble and generous her soul, in a word the worthier
she is of our respect, just so much greater the danger
through which she must pass.</p>

<p>It is always perilous, for a girl, to suffer her
memories to group themselves too repeatedly and too
agreeably round the same individual. Add gratitude,
admiration or curiosity to strengthen the bonds of
memory, and she is almost certainly on the edge of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>precipice. The greater the monotony of her everyday
life, the more active are those poisons called gratitude,
admiration and curiosity. The only thing, then, is a
swift, prompt and vigorous distraction.</p>

<p>Just so, a little roughness and "slap-dash" in the
first encounter, is an almost infallible means of winning
the respect of a clever woman, if only the drug be
administered in a natural and simple manner.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XL</h3>

<p>Every kind of love and every kind of imagination,
in the individual, takes its colour from one of
these six temperaments:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>The sanguine, or French,&mdash;M. de Francueil (Memoirs
of Madame d'Épinay);</li>

<li>The choleric, or Spanish,&mdash;Lauzun (the Peguilhen of
Saint-Simon's Memoirs);</li>

<li>The melancholy, or German,&mdash;Schiller's Don Carlos;</li>

<li>The phlegmatic, or Dutch;</li>

<li>The nervous&mdash;Voltaire;</li>

<li>The athletic&mdash;Milo of Croton.<a name="FNanchor_1_141" id="FNanchor_1_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_141" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If the influence of temperament makes itself felt in
ambition, avarice, friendship, etc. etc., what must it
be in the case of love, in which the physical also is perforce
an ingredient? Let us suppose that all kinds of
love can be referred to the four varieties, which we have
noted:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Passion-love&mdash;Julie d'Étanges;<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_23" id="TNanch_23"></a><a href="#TN_23">(23)</a></span></li>

<li>Gallant-love or gallantry;</li>

<li>Physical love;</li>

<li>Vanity-love&mdash;"a duchess is never more than thirty for
a bourgeois."</li>
</ul>

<p>We must submit these four kinds of love to the
six different characters, with which habits, dependent
upon the six kinds of temperament, stamp the imagination.
Tiberius did not have the wild imagination of
Henry VIII.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>Then let us submit all these combinations, thus obtained,
to the differences of habit which depend upon
government or national character:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Asiatic despotism, such as may be seen at Constantinople;</li>

<li>Absolute monarchy <i>à la</i> Louis XIV;</li>

<li>Aristocracy masked by a charter, or government of
a nation for the profit of the rich, as in England&mdash;all
according to the rules of a self-styled biblical morality;</li>

<li>A federal republic, or government for the profit of
all, as in the United States of America;</li>

<li>Constitutional monarchy, or&mdash;</li>

<li>A State in revolution, as Spain, Portugal, France<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_24" id="TNanch_24"></a><a href="#TN_24">(24)</a></span>.
This state of things in a country gives lively
passions to everyone, makes manners more natural,
destroys puerilities, the conventional virtues and senseless
proprieties<a name="FNanchor_2_142" id="FNanchor_2_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_142" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>&mdash;gives seriousness to youth and causes it to
despise vanity-love and neglect gallantry.<br />
This state can last a long time and form the habits of
a generation. In France it began in 1788, was interrupted
in 1802, and began again in 1818&mdash;to end God knows
when!</li>
</ol>

<p>After all these general ways of considering love, we
have the differences of age, and come finally to individual
peculiarities.</p>

<p>For example, we might say:&mdash;</p>

<p>I found at Dresden, in Count Woltstein, vanity-love,
a melancholy temperament, monarchical habits, thirty
years, and ... his individual peculiarities.</p>

<p>For anyone who is to form a judgment on love, this
way of viewing things is conveniently short and cooling
to the head&mdash;an essential, but difficult operation.</p>

<p>Now, as in physiology man has learnt scarcely anything
about himself, except by means of comparative anatomy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>so in the case of passions, through vanity and many other
causes of illusion, we can only get enlightenment on
what goes on in ourselves from the foibles we have
observed in others. If by chance this essay has any useful
effect, it will be by bringing the mind to make comparisons
of this sort. To lead the way, I am going to attempt
a sketch of some general traits in the character of love in
different nations.</p>

<p>I beg for pardon if I often come back to Italy; in the
present state of manners in Europe, it is the only country
where the plant, which I describe, grows in all freedom.
In France, vanity; in Germany, a pretentious and
highly comical philosophy; in England, pride, timid,
painful and rancorous, torture and stifle it, or force it
into a crooked channel.<a name="FNanchor_3_143" id="FNanchor_3_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_143" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF NATIONS WITH REGARD TO LOVE.<br />

FRANCE</span></h3>

<p>I mean to put aside my natural affections and be
only a cold philosopher. French women, fashioned
by their amiable men, themselves creatures only of vanity
and physical desires, are less active, less energetic, less
feared, and, what's more, less loved and less powerful,
than Spanish and Italian women.</p>

<p>A woman is powerful only according to the degree of
unhappiness, which she can inflict as punishment on her
lover. Where men have nothing but vanity, every
woman is useful, but none is indispensable. It is
success in winning a woman's love, not in keeping it,
which flatters a man. When men have only physical
desires, they go to prostitutes, and that is why the
prostitutes of France are charming and those of Spain
the very reverse. In France, to a great many men
prostitutes can give as much happiness as virtuous women&mdash;happiness,
that is to say, without love. There is
always one thing for which a Frenchman has much more
respect than for his mistress&mdash;his vanity.</p>

<p>In Paris a young man sees in his mistress a kind of
slave, whose destiny it is, before everything, to please
his vanity. If she resist the orders of this dominating
passion, he leaves her&mdash;and is only the better pleased with
himself, when he can tell his friends in what a piquant
way, with how smart a gesture, he waved her off.</p>

<p>A Frenchman, who knew his own country well (Meilhan),
said: "In France, great passions are as rare as
great men."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>No language has words to express how impossible
it is for a Frenchman to play the role of a deserted and
desperate lover, in full view of a whole town&mdash;yet no
sight is commoner at Venice or Bologna.</p>

<p>To find love at Paris, we must descend to those classes,
in which the absence of education and of vanity, and the
struggle against real want, have left more energy.</p>

<p>To let oneself be seen with a great and unsatisfied
desire, is to let oneself be seen in a position of inferiority&mdash;and
that is impossible in France, except for people of
no position at all. It means exposing oneself to all kinds
of sneers&mdash;hence come the exaggerated praises bestowed
on prostitutes by young men who mistrust their
own hearts. A vulgar susceptibility and dread of
appearing in a position of inferiority forms the
principle of conversation among provincial people.
Think of the man who only lately, when told of the
assassination of H. R. H. the Duke of Berri<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_25" id="TNanch_25"></a><a href="#TN_25">(25)</a></span>, answered:
"I knew it."<a name="FNanchor_1_144" id="FNanchor_1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_144" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In the Middle Ages hearts were tempered by the
presence of danger, and therein, unless I am mistaken,
lies another cause of the astonishing superiority of the
men of the sixteenth century. Originality, which among
us is rare, comical, dangerous and often affected, was then
of everyday and unadorned. Countries where even
to-day danger often shows its iron hand, such as Corsica,<a name="FNanchor_2_145" id="FNanchor_2_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_145" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Spain or Italy, can still produce great men. In those
climates, where men's gall cooks for three months under
the burning heat, it is activity's direction that is to seek;
at Paris, I fear, it is activity itself.<a name="FNanchor_3_146" id="FNanchor_3_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_146" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Many young men, fine enough to be sure at Montmirail
or the Bois de Boulogne, are afraid of love; and
when you see them, at the age of twenty, fly the sight
of a young girl who has struck them as pretty, you may
know that cowardice is the real cause. When they
remember what they have read in novels is expected of
a lover, their blood runs cold. These chilly spirits cannot
conceive how the storm of passion, which lashes the sea
to waves, also fills the sails of the ship and gives her the
power of riding over them.</p>

<p>Love is a delicious flower, but one must have the
courage to go and pick it on the edge of a frightful
precipice. Besides ridicule, love has always staring it in
the face the desperate plight of being deserted by the
loved one, and in her place only a <i>dead blank</i> for all the
rest of one's life.</p>

<p>Civilisation would be perfect, if it could continue the
delicate pleasures of the nineteenth century with a more
frequent presence of danger.<a name="FNanchor_4_147" id="FNanchor_4_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_147" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>It ought to be possible to augment a thousandfold the
pleasures of private life by exposing it frequently to danger.
I do not speak only of military danger. I would have
this danger present at every instant, in every shape, and
threatening all the interests of existence, such as formed
the essence of life in the Middle Ages. Such danger as
our civilisation has trained and refined, goes hand in
hand quite naturally with the most insipid feebleness of
character.</p>

<p>I hear the words of a great man in <i>A Voice from St
Helena</i> by Mr. O'Meara:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Order Murat to attack and destroy four or five thousand men
in such a direction, it was done in a moment; but leave him to
himself, he was an imbecile without judgment. I cannot conceive
how so brave a man could be so "lâche." He was nowhere
brave unless before the enemy. There he was probably the
bravest man in the world.... He was a paladin, in fact a Don
Quixote in the field; but take him into the Cabinet, he was a
poltroon without judgment or decision. Murat and Ney were
the bravest men I ever witnessed. (O'Meara, Vol. II, p. 95.)</p></blockquote>

of one hundred and eighty thousand souls, would not form a half
of most French Departments, has produced in modern times Salliceti,
Pozzo di Borgo, General Sebastiani, Cervioni, Abbatucci, Lucien and
Napoleon Bonaparte and Aréna. The Département du Nord, with its
nine hundred thousand inhabitants, is far from being able to show a
similar list. The reason is that in Corsica anyone, on leaving his house,
may be greeted by a bullet; and the Corsican, instead of submitting like a
good Christian, tries to defend himself and still more to be revenged.
That is the way spirits like Napoleon are forged. It's a long cry from
such surroundings to a palace with its lords-in-waiting and chamberlains,
and a Fénelon obliged to find reasons for his respect to His Royal Highness,
when speaking to H. R. H. himself, aged twelve years. See the works of
that great writer.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_3_146" id="Footnote_3_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_146"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> At Paris, to get on, you must pay attention to a million little details.
None the less there is this very powerful objection. Statistics show many
more women who commit suicide from love at Paris than in all the
towns of Italy together. This fact gives me great difficulty; I do not
know what to say to it for the moment, but it doesn't change my opinion.
It may be that our ultra-civilised life is so wearisome, that death seems
a small matter to the Frenchman of to-day&mdash;or more likely, overwhelmed
by the wreck of his vanity, he blows out his brains.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_4_147" id="Footnote_4_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_147"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> I admire the manners of the time of Lewis XIV: many a man
might pass in three days from the salons of Marly to the battlefield
of Senet or Ramillies. Wives, mothers, sweethearts, were all in a
continual state of apprehension. See the Letters of Madame de Sévigné.
The presence of danger had kept in the language an energy and a freshness
that we would not dare to hazard nowadays; and yet M. de Lameth
killed his wife's lover. If a Walter Scott were to write a novel of the
times of Lewis XIV, we should be a good deal surprised.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XLII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">FRANCE (<i>continued</i>)</span></h3>


<p>I beg leave to speak ill of France a little longer.
The reader need have no fear of seeing my satire
remain unpunished; if this essay finds readers, I shall
pay for my insults with interest. Our national honour
is wide awake.</p>

<p>France fills an important place in the plan of this
book, because Paris, thanks to the superiority of its conversation
and its literature, is, and will always be, the
<i>salon</i> of Europe.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of the <i>billets</i> in Vienna, as in London,
are written in French or are full of French allusions
and quotations&mdash;Lord knows what French!<a name="FNanchor_1_148" id="FNanchor_1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_148" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>As regards great passions, France, in my opinion, is
void of originality from two causes:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. True honour&mdash;the desire to resemble Bayard<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_26" id="TNanch_26"></a><a href="#TN_26">(26)</a></span>&mdash;in
order to be honoured in the world and there, every
day, to see your vanity satisfied.</p>

<p>2. The fool's honour, or the desire to resemble the
upper classes, the fashionable world of Paris. The art
of entering a drawing-room, of showing aversion to a
rival, of breaking with your mistress, etc.</p>

<p>The fool's honour is much more useful than true
honour in ministering to the pleasures of our vanity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>both in itself, as being intelligible to fools, and also as
being applicable to the actions of every day and every
hour. We see people, with only this fool's honour and
without true honour, very well received in society;
but the contrary is impossible.</p>

<p>This is the way of the fashionable world:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. To treat all great interests ironically. 'Tis natural
enough. Formerly people, really in society, could not be
profoundly affected by anything; they hadn't the time.
Residence in the country has altered all this. Besides, it
is contrary to a Frenchman's nature to let himself be
seen in a posture of admiration,<a name="FNanchor_2_149" id="FNanchor_2_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_149" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> that is to say, in a
position of inferiority, not only in relation to the object
of his admiration&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;but also in
relation to his neighbour, if his neighbour choose to
mock at what he admires.</p>

<p>In Germany, Italy and Spain, on the contrary, admiration
is genuine and happy; there the admirer is proud
of his transports and pities the man who turns up his
nose. I don't say the mocker, for that's an impossible
rôle in countries, where it is not in failing in the imitation
of a particular line of conduct, but in failing to strike
the road to happiness, that the only ridicule exists. In
the South, mistrust and horror at being troubled in the
midst of pleasures vividly felt, plants in men an inborn
admiration of luxury and pomp. See the Courts of
Madrid and Naples; see a <i>funzione</i> at Cadiz&mdash;things are
carried to a point of delirium.<a name="FNanchor_3_150" id="FNanchor_3_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_150" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>2. A Frenchman thinks himself the most miserable of
men, and almost the most ridiculous, if he is obliged to
spend his time alone. But what is love without solitude?</p>

<p>3. A passionate man thinks only of himself; a man
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>who wants consideration thinks only of others. Nay
more: before 1789, individual security was only found
in France by becoming one of a body, the Robe, for
example,<a name="FNanchor_4_151" id="FNanchor_4_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_151" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and by being protected by the members of
that body. The thoughts of your neighbour were then
an integral and necessary part of your happiness. This
was still truer at the Court than in Paris. It is easy to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>see how far such manners, which, to say the truth, are
every day losing their force, but which Frenchmen will
retain for another century, are favourable to great
passions.</p>

<p>Try to imagine a man throwing himself from a
window, and at the same time trying to reach the pavement
in a graceful position.</p>

<p>In France, the passionate man, merely as such, and in
no other light, is the object of general ridicule. Altogether,
he offends his fellow-men, and that gives wings to ridicule.</p>

Captain commanding the guards of the Duke of Orleans, being piqued
at finding no place left in the balcony, the day of the opening of the new
hall, was so ill-advised as to dispute his place with an honest Procureur;
the latter, one Maître Pernot, was by no means willing to give it up.&mdash;'You've
taken my place.'&mdash;'I'm in my own.'&mdash;'Who are you?'&mdash;'I'm
Mr. Six Francs'... (that is to say, the price of these places). Then,
angrier words, insults, jostling. Comte de N&mdash;&mdash; pushed his indiscretion
so far as to treat the poor joker as a thief, and finally took it upon
himself to order the sergeant on duty to arrest the person of the Procureur,
and to conduct him to the guard-room. Maître Pernot surrendered with
great dignity, and went out, only to go and depose his complaint before
a Commissary. The redoubtable body, of which he had the honour to
be a member, had no intention of letting the matter drop. The affair
came up before the Parlement. M. de N&mdash;&mdash; was condemned to pay all
the expenses, to make reparation to the Procureur, to pay him two
thousand crowns damages and interest, which were to be applied, with
the Procureur's consent, to the poor prisoners of the Conciergerie;
further, the said Count was very expressly enjoined never again, under
pretext of the king's orders, to interfere with a performance, etc. This
adventure made a lot of noise, and great interests were mixed up in it:
the whole Robe has considered itself insulted by an outrage done to a
man who wears its livery, etc. M. de N&mdash;&mdash;, that his affair may be forgotten,
has gone to seek his laurels at the Camp of St. Roch. He couldn't
do better, people say, for no one can doubt of his talent for carrying
places by sheer force. Now suppose an obscure philosopher in the place
of Maître Pernot. Use of the Duel. (Grimm, Part III, Vol. II, p. 102.)
</p>
<p>
See further on, p. 496, a most sensible letter of Beaumarchais refusing
a closed box (<i>loge grillée</i>) for Figaro, which one of his friends had asked
of him. So long as people thought that his answer was addressed to a
Duke, there was great excitement, and they talked about severe punishment.
But it turned to laughter when Beaumarchais declared that his
letter was addressed to Monsieur le Président du Paty. It is a far cry
from 1785 to 1822! We no longer understand these feelings. And yet
people pretend that the same tragedies that touched those generations
are still good for us!</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ITALY<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_27" id="TNanch_27"></a><a href="#TN_27">(27)</a></span></span></h3>

<p>Italy's good fortune is that it has been left to the
inspiration of the moment, a good fortune which
it shares, up to a certain point, with Germany and
England.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Italy is a country where Utility, which
was the guiding principle of the mediæval republic,<a name="FNanchor_1_152" id="FNanchor_1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_152" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> has
not been dethroned by Honour or Virtue, disposed to the advantages
of monarchy.<a name="FNanchor_2_153" id="FNanchor_2_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_153" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> True honour leads the way to the
fool's honour. It accustoms men to ask themselves: What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>will my neighbour think of my happiness? But how can
happiness of the heart be an object of vanity, since no
one can see it.?<a name="FNanchor_3_154" id="FNanchor_3_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_154" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In proof of all this, France is the
country, where there are fewer marriages from inclination
than anywhere else in the world.<a name="FNanchor_4_155" id="FNanchor_4_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_155" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And Italy has other advantages. The Italian has undisturbed
leisure and an admirable climate, which makes
men sensible to beauty under every form. He is extremely,
yet reasonably, mistrustful, which increases the
aloofness of intimate love and doubles its charms. He
reads no novels, indeed hardly any books, and this leaves
still more to the inspiration of the moment. He has
a passion for music, which excites in the soul a movement
very similar to that of love.</p>

<p>In France, towards 1770, there was no mistrust.; on
the contrary, it was good form to live and die before the
public. As the Duchess of Luxemburg was intimate
with a hundred friends, there was no intimacy and no
friendship, properly so-called.</p>

<p>In Italy, passion, since it is not a very rare distinction,
is not a subject of ridicule,<a name="FNanchor_5_156" id="FNanchor_5_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_156" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and you may hear people
in the <i>salons</i> openly quoting general maxims of love.
The public knows the symptoms and periods of this
illness, and is very much concerned with it. They say
to a man who has been deserted: "You'll be in despair
for six months, but you'll get over it in the end, like
So-and-so, etc."</p>

<p>In Italy, public opinion is the very humble attendant
on passion. Real pleasure there exercises the power,
which elsewhere is in the hands of society. 'Tis quite
simple&mdash;for society can give scarcely any pleasure to
a people, who has no time to be vain, and can have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>but little authority over those, who are only trying to
escape the notice of their "pacha"<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_29" id="TNanch_29"></a><a href="#TN_29">(29)</a></span>. The <i>blasés</i>
censure the passionate&mdash;but who cares for them? South
of the Alps, society is a despot without a prison.</p>

<p>As in Paris honour challenges, sword in hand, or,
if possible, <i>bon mot</i> in the mouth, every approach
to every recognised great interest, it is much more convenient
to take refuge in irony. Many young men have
taken up a different attitude, and become disciples of
J. J. Rousseau and Madame de Staël. As irony had
become vulgar, one had to fall back on feelings. A. de
Pezai in our days writes like M. Darlincourt. Besides,
since 1789, everything tends to favour utility or individual
sensibility, as opposed to honour or the empire of opinion.
The sight of the two Chambers teaches people to discuss
everything, even mere nonsense. The nation is becoming
serious, and gallantry is losing ground.</p>

<p>As a Frenchman, I ought to say that it is not a small
number of colossal fortunes, but the multiplicity of
middling ones, that makes up the riches of a country.
In every country passion is rare, and gallantry is more
graceful and refined: in France, as a consequence, it has
better fortune. This great nation, the first in the world,<a name="FNanchor_6_157" id="FNanchor_6_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_157" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
has the same kind of aptitude for love as for intellectual
achievements. In 1822 we have, to be sure, no Moore,
no Walter Scott, no Crabbe, no Byron, no Monti, no
Pellico; but we have among us more men of intellect,
clear-sighted, agreeable and up to the level of the lights
of this century, than England has, or Italy. It is for
this reason that the debates in our Chamber of Deputies
in 1822, are so superior to those in the English Parliament,
and that when a Liberal from England comes to France,
we are quite surprised to find in him several opinions
which are distinctly feudal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am exceedingly uncomfortable here; I suppose it's because I
have no leisure for falling in love at my ease. Here, sensibility is
spent drop by drop, just as it forms, in such a way, at least so I
find it, as to be a drain on the source. At Rome, owing to the
little interest created by the events of every day and the somnolence
of the outside world, sensibility accumulates to the profit of
passion.</p></blockquote>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ROME</span></h3>


<p>Only at Rome<a name="FNanchor_1_158" id="FNanchor_1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_158" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> can a respectable woman, seated
in her carriage, say effusively to another woman,
a mere acquaintance, what I heard this morning: "Ah,
my dear, beware of love with Fabio Vitteleschi; better
for you to fall in love with a highwayman! For all his
soft and measured air, he is capable of stabbing you to
the heart with a knife, and of saying with the sweetest
smile, while he plunged the knife into your breast:
'Poor child, does it hurt?'" And this conversation
took place in the presence of a pretty young lady of
fifteen, daughter of the woman who received the advice,
and a very wide-awake young lady.</p>

<p>If a man from the North has the misfortune not to
be shocked at first by the candour of this southern
capacity for love, which is nothing but the simple product
of a magnificent nature, favoured by the twofold
absence of <i>good form</i> and of all interesting novelty,
after a stay of one year the women of all other countries
will become intolerable to him.</p>

<p>He will find Frenchwomen, perfectly charming, with
their little graces,<a name="FNanchor_2_159" id="FNanchor_2_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_159" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> seductive for the first three days, but
boring the fourth&mdash;fatal day, when one discovers that
all these graces, studied beforehand, and learned by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>rote, are eternally the same, every day and for every
lover.</p>

<p>He will see German women, on the contrary, so very
natural, and giving themselves up with so much ardour
to their imagination, but often with nothing to show in
the end, for all their naturalness, but barrenness, insipidity,
and blue-stocking tenderness. The phrase of
Count Almaviva<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_30" id="TNanch_30"></a><a href="#TN_30">(30)</a></span> seems made for Germany: "And
one is quite astonished, one fine evening, to find satiety,
where one went to look for happiness."</p>

<p>At Rome, the foreigner must not forget that, if
nothing is tedious in countries where everything is
natural, the bad is there still more bad than elsewhere.
To speak only of the men,<a name="FNanchor_3_160" id="FNanchor_3_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_160" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> we can see appearing here in
society a kind of monster, who elsewhere lies low&mdash;a man
passionate, clear-sighted and base, all in an equal degree.
Suppose evil chance has set him near a woman in some
capacity or other: madly in love with her, suppose,
he will drink to the very dregs the misery of seeing her
prefer a rival. There he is to oppose her happier lover.
Nothing escapes him, and everyone sees that nothing
escapes him; but he continues none the less, in despite
of every honourable sentiment, to trouble the woman,
her lover and himself. No one blames him&mdash;"That's
his way of getting pleasure."&mdash;"He is doing what gives
him pleasure." One evening, the lover, at the end of
his patience, gives him a kick. The next day the wretch
is full of excuses, and begins again to torment, constantly
and imperturbably, the woman, the lover and himself.
One shudders, when one thinks of the amount of unhappiness
that these base spirits have every day to swallow&mdash;and
doubtless there is but one grain less of cowardice
between them and a poisoner.</p>

<p>It is also only in Italy that you can see young and
elegant millionaires entertaining with magnificence, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>full view of a whole town, ballet girls from a big theatre,
at a cost of thirty halfpence a day.<a name="FNanchor_4_161" id="FNanchor_4_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_161" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Two brothers X&mdash;&mdash;, fine young fellows, always hunting
and on horseback, are jealous of a foreigner. Instead
of going and laying their complaint before him, they are
sullen, and spread abroad unfavourable reports of this
poor foreigner. In France, public opinion would force
such men to prove their words or give satisfaction to the
foreigner. Here public opinion and contempt mean
nothing. Riches are always certain of being well received
everywhere. A millionaire, dishonoured and excluded
from every house in Paris, can go quite securely to Rome;
there he will be estimated just according to the value
of his dollars.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLV<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ENGLAND<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_31" id="TNanch_31"></a><a href="#TN_31">(31)</a></span></span></h3>


<p>I have lived a good deal of late with the ballet-girls
of the Teatro Del Sol, at Valencia. People
assure me that many of them are very chaste; the reason
being that their profession is too fatiguing. Vigano makes
them rehearse his ballet, the <i>Jewess of Toledo</i>, every
day, from ten in the morning to four, and from midnight
to three in the morning. Besides this, they have
to dance every evening in both ballets.</p>

<p>This reminds me that Rousseau prescribes a great
deal of walking for Émile. This evening I was strolling
at midnight with these little ballet girls out along the
seashore, and I was thinking especially how unknown to
us, in our sad lands of mist, is this superhuman delight
in the freshness of a sea breeze under this Valencian sky,
under the eyes of these resplendent stars that seem close
above us. This alone repays the journey of four hundred
leagues; this it is that banishes thought, for feeling
is too strong. I thought that the chastity of my little
ballet girls gives the explanation of the course adopted
by English pride, in order, little by little, to bring back
the morals of the harem into the midst of a civilised
nation. One sees how it is that some of these young
English girls, otherwise so beautiful and with so touching
an expression, leave something to be desired as
regards ideas. In spite of liberty, which has only just
been banished from their island, and the admirable
originality of their national character, they lack interesting
ideas and originality. Often there is nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>remarkable in them but the extravagance of their refinements.
It's simple enough&mdash;in England the modesty
of the women is the pride of their husbands. But,
however submissive a slave may be, her society becomes
sooner or later a burden. Hence, for the men, the necessity
of getting drunk solemnly every evening,<a name="FNanchor_1_162" id="FNanchor_1_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_162" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> instead of
as in Italy, passing the evening with their mistresses.
In England, rich people, bored with their homes and
under the pretext of necessary exercise, walk four or
five leagues a day, as if man were created and put into
the world to trot up and down it. They use up their
nervous fluid by means of their legs, not their hearts;
after which, they may well talk of female refinement
and look down on Spain and Italy.</p>

<p>No life, on the other hand, could be less busy than
that of young Italians; to them all action is importunate,
if it take away their sensibility. From time to time they
take a walk of half a league for health's sake, as an unpleasant
medicine. As for the women, a Roman woman
in a whole year does not walk as far as a young Miss in
a week.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the pride of an English husband
exalts very adroitly the vanity of his wretched wife. He
persuades her, first of all, that one must not be vulgar,
and the mothers, who are getting their daughters ready
to find husbands, are quick enough to seize upon this
idea. Hence fashion is far more absurd and despotic
in reasonable England than in the midst of light-hearted
France: in Bond Street was invented the idea of the
"carefully careless." In England fashion is a duty, at
Paris it is a pleasure. In London fashion raises a wall of
bronze between New Bond Street and Fenchurch Street
far different from that between the Chaussée d'Antin
and the rue Saint-Martin at Paris. Husbands are quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>willing to allow their wives this aristocratic nonsense, to
make up for the enormous amount of unhappiness, which
they impose on them. I recognise a perfect picture
of women's society in England, such as the taciturn
pride of its men produces, in the once celebrated novels
of Miss Burney. Since it is vulgar to ask for a glass of
water, when one is thirsty, Miss Burney's heroines do
not fail to let themselves die of thirst. While flying from
vulgarity, they fall into the most abominable affectation.</p>

<p>Compare the prudence of a young Englishman of
twenty-two with the profound mistrust of a young
Italian of the same age. The Italian must be mistrustful
to be safe, but this mistrust he puts aside, or at least
forgets, as soon as he becomes intimate, while it is apparently
just in his most tender relationships that you
see the young Englishman redouble his prudence and
aloofness. I once heard this:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the last seven months I haven't spoken to her of
the trip to Brighton." This was a question of a necessary
economy of twenty-four pounds, and a lover of twenty-two
years speaking of a mistress, a married woman, whom
he adored. In the transports of his passion prudence
had not left him: far less had he let himself go enough
to say to his mistress: "I shan't go to Brighton, because
I should feel the pinch."</p>

<p>Note that the fate of Gianone de Pellico, and of a
hundred others, forces the Italian to be mistrustful,
while the young English <i>beau</i> is only forced to be prudent
by the excessive and morbid sensibility of his vanity. A
Frenchman, charming enough with his inspirations of
the minute, tells everything to her he loves. It is habit.
Without it he would lack ease, and he knows that without
ease there is no grace.</p>

<p>It is with difficulty and with tears in my eyes that I
have plucked up courage to write all this; but, since
I would not, I'm sure, flatter a king, why should I
say of a country anything but what seems to me the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>truth? Of course it may be all very absurd, for the simple
reason that this country gave birth to the most lovable
woman that I have known.</p>

<p>It would be another form of cringing before a monarch.
I will content myself with adding that in the midst of
all this variety of manners, among so many Englishwomen,
who are the spiritual victims of Englishmen's pride, a
perfect form of originality does exist, and that a family,
brought up aloof from these distressing restrictions (invented
to reproduce the morals of the harem) may be
responsible for charming characters. And how insufficient,
in spite of its etymology,&mdash;and how common&mdash;is
this word "charming" to render what I would express.
The gentle Imogen, the tender Ophelia might find
plenty of living models in England; but these models
are far from enjoying the high veneration that is unanimously
accorded to the true accomplished Englishwoman,
whose destiny is to show complete obedience to every
convention and to afford a husband full enjoyment of
the most morbid aristocratic pride and a happiness that
makes him die of boredom.<a name="FNanchor_2_163" id="FNanchor_2_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_163" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In the great suites of fifteen or twenty rooms, so
fresh and so dark, in which Italian women pass their
lives softly propped on low divans, they hear people
speak of love and of music for six hours in the day. At
night, at the theatre, hidden in their boxes for four
hours, they hear people speak of music and love.</p>

<p>Then, besides the climate, the whole way of living is
in Spain or Italy as favourable to music and love, as it
is the contrary in England.</p>

<p>I neither blame nor approve; I observe.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ENGLAND&mdash;(<i>continued</i>)</span></h3>


<p>I love England too much and I have seen of her too
little to be able to speak on the subject. I shall
make use of the observations of a friend.</p>

<p>In the actual state of Ireland (1822) is realised, for the
twentieth time in two centuries,<a name="FNanchor_1_164" id="FNanchor_1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_164" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that curious state of
society which is so fruitful of courageous resolutions, and
so opposed to a monotonous existence, and in which
people, who breakfast gaily together, may meet in two
hours' time on the field of battle. Nothing makes a
more energetic and direct appeal to that disposition of
the spirit, which is most favourable to the tender passions&mdash;to
naturalness. Nothing is further removed from
the two great English vices&mdash;cant and bashfulness,&mdash;moral
hypocrisy and haughty, painful timidity. (See
the Travels of Mr. Eustace<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_32" id="TNanch_32"></a><a href="#TN_32">(32)</a></span> in Italy.) If this traveller
gives a poor picture of the country, in return he gives a
very exact idea of his own character, and this character, as
that of Mr. Beattie<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_32">(32)</a></span>, the poet (see his Life written
by an intimate friend), is unhappily but too common in
England. For the priest, honest in spite of his cloth,
refer to the letters of the Bishop of Landaff.<a name="FNanchor_2_165" id="FNanchor_2_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_165" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_32">(32)</a></span>.</p>

<p>One would have thought Ireland already unfortunate
enough, bled as it has been for two centuries by the
cowardly and cruel tyranny of England; but now there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>enters into the moral state of Ireland a terrible personage:
the <span class="smcap">Priest</span>....</p>

<p>For two centuries Ireland has been almost as badly
governed as Sicily. A thorough comparison between these
two islands, in a volume of five hundred pages, would
offend many people and overwhelm many established
theories with ridicule. What is evident is that the happiest
of these two countries&mdash;both of them governed by
fools, only for the profit of a minority&mdash;is Sicily. Its
governors have at least left it its love of pleasure; they
would willingly have robbed it of this as of the rest,
but, thanks to its climate, Sicily knows little of that moral
evil called Law and Government.<a name="FNanchor_3_166" id="FNanchor_3_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_166" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It is old men and priests who make the laws and have
them executed, and this seems quite in keeping with the
comic jealousy, with which pleasure is hunted down in the
British Isles. The people there might say to its governors
as Diogenes said to Alexander: "Be content with your
sinecures, but please don't step between me and my
daylight."<a name="FNanchor_4_167" id="FNanchor_4_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_167" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>By means of laws, rules, counter-rules and punishments,
the Government in Ireland has created the potato, and
the population of Ireland exceeds by far that of Sicily.
This is to say, they have produced several millions of
degenerate and half-witted peasants, broken down by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>work and misery, dragging out a wretched life of some
forty or fifty years among the marshes of old Erin&mdash;and,
you may be sure, paying their taxes! A real miracle!
With the pagan religion these poor wretches would at
least have enjoyed some happiness&mdash;but not a bit of it,
they must adore St. Patrick.</p>

<p>Everywhere in Ireland one sees none but peasants
more miserable than savages. Only, instead of there
being a hundred thousand, as there would be in a state
of nature, there are eight millions,<a name="FNanchor_5_168" id="FNanchor_5_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_168" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> who allow five hundred
"absentees" to live in prosperity at London or Paris.</p>

<p>Society is infinitely more advanced in Scotland,<a name="FNanchor_6_169" id="FNanchor_6_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_169" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> where,
in very many respects, government is good (the rarity
of crime, the diffusion of reading, the non-existence of
bishops, etc.). There the tender passions can develop
much more freely, and it is possible to leave these
sombre thoughts and approach the humorous.</p>

<p>One cannot fail to notice a foundation of melancholy
in Scottish women. This melancholy is particularly
seductive at dances, where it gives a singular piquancy
to the extreme ardour and energy with which they perform
their national dances. Edinburgh has another
advantage, that of being withdrawn from the vile empire
of money. In this, as well as in the singular and savage
beauty of its site, this city forms a complete contrast
with London. Like Rome, fair Edinburgh seems rather
the sojourn of the contemplative life. At London you
have the ceaseless whirlwind and restless interests of
active life, with all its advantages and inconveniences.
Edinburgh seems to me to pay its tribute to the devil by
a slight disposition to pedantry. Those days when Mary
Stuart lived at old Holyrood, and Riccio was assassinated
in her arms, were worth more to Love (and here all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>women will agree with me) than to-day, when one discusses
at such length, and even in their presence, the
preference to be accorded to the neptunian system over
the vulcanian system of ... I prefer a discussion on
the new uniform given by the king to the Guards, or
on the peerage which Sir B. Bloomfield<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_35" id="TNanch_35"></a><a href="#TN_35">(35)</a></span> failed to
get&mdash;the topic of London in my day&mdash;to a learned
discussion as to who has best explored the nature of
rocks, de Werner or de....</p>

<p>I say nothing about the terrible Scottish Sunday, after
which a Sunday in London looks like a beanfeast. That
day, set aside for the honour of Heaven, is the best
image of Hell that I have ever seen on earth. "Don't
let's walk so fast," said a Scotchman returning from church
to a Frenchman, his friend; "people might think we
were going for a walk."<a name="FNanchor_7_170" id="FNanchor_7_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_170" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Of the three countries, Ireland is the one in which
there is the least hypocrisy. See the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i>
thundering against Mozart and the <i>Nozze di
Figaro</i>.<a name="FNanchor_8_171" id="FNanchor_8_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_171" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>In every country it is the aristocrats, who try to judge
a literary magazine and literature; and for the last four
years in England these have been hand in glove with the
bishops. As I say, that of the three countries where, it
seems to me, there is the least hypocrisy, is Ireland:
on the contrary, you find there a reckless, a most
fascinating vivacity. In Scotland there is the strict
observance of Sunday, but on Monday they dance with
a joy and an abandon unknown to London. There is
plenty of love among the peasant class in Scotland. The

<p>The terrible fault of English society, that which in a

national debt and its consequences, and even than the

this sentence which I heard last autumn at Croydon,
before the beautiful statue of the bishop: "In society
no one wants to put himself forward, for fear of being
deceived in his expectations."</p>

<p>Judge what laws, under the name of modesty, such
men must impose on their wives and mistresses.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">SPAIN<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_36" id="TNanch_36"></a><a href="#TN_36">(36)</a></span></span></h3>


<p>Andalusia is one of the most charming sojourns
that Pleasure has chosen for itself on earth. I
had three or four anecdotes to show how my ideas about
the three or four different acts of madness, which
together constitute Love, hold good for Spain: I have
been advised to sacrifice them to French refinement.
In vain I protested that I wrote in French, but emphatically
not French literature. God preserve me from
having anything in common with the French writers
esteemed to-day!</p>

<p>The Moors, when they abandoned Andalusia, left it
their architecture and much of their manners. Since it
is impossible for me to speak of the latter in the language
of Madame de Sévigné, I'll at least say this of Moorish
architecture:&mdash;its principal trait consists in providing
every house with a little garden surrounded by an elegant
and graceful portico. There, during the unbearable
heat of summer, when for whole weeks together the
Réaumur thermometer never falls below a constant level
of thirty degrees, a delicious obscurity pervades these
porticoes. In the middle of the little garden there is
always a fountain, monotonous and voluptuous, whose
sound is all that stirs this charming retreat. The
marble basin is surrounded by a dozen orange-trees
and laurels. A thick canvas, like a tent, covers in the
whole of the little garden, and, while it protects it from
the rays of the sun and from the light, lets in the gentle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>breezes which, at midday, come down from the mountains.</p>

<p>There live and receive their guests the fair ladies of
Andalusia: a simple black silk robe, ornamented with
fringes of the same colour, and giving glimpses of a
charming ankle; a pale complexion and eyes that
mirror all the most fugitive shades of the most tender
and ardent passion&mdash;such are the celestial beings, whom
I am forbidden to bring upon the scene.</p>

<p>I look upon the Spanish people as the living representatives
of the Middle Age.</p>

<p>It is ignorant of a mass of little truths (the puerile vanity
of its neighbours); but it has a profound knowledge of
great truths and enough character and wit to follow their
consequences down to their most remote effects. The
Spanish character offers a fine contrast to French
intellect&mdash;hard, brusque, inelegant, full of savage pride,
and unconcerned with others. It is just the contrast
of the fifteenth with the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>Spain provides me with a good contrast; the only
people, that was able to withstand Napoleon, seems to
me to be absolutely lacking in the fool's honour and in
all that is foolish in honour.</p>

<p>Instead of making fine military ordinances, of changing
uniforms every six months and of wearing large spurs,
Spain has general <i>No importa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1_172" id="FNanchor_1_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_172" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLVIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">GERMAN LOVE<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_37" id="TNanch_37"></a><a href="#TN_37">(37)</a></span></span></h3>


<p>If the Italian, always agitated between love and hate,
is a creature of passion, and the Frenchman of
vanity, the good and simple descendants of the ancient
Germans are assuredly creatures of imagination. Scarcely
raised above social interests, the most directly necessary
to their subsistence, one is amazed to see them soar into
what they call their philosophy, which is a sort of gentle,
lovable, quite harmless folly. I am going to cite, not
altogether from memory, but from hurriedly taken
notes, a work whose author, though writing in a tone of
opposition, illustrates clearly, even in his admirations,
the military spirit in all its excesses&mdash;I speak of the Travels
in Austria of M. Cadet-Gassicourt, in 1809. What would
the noble and generous Desaix have said, if he had seen
the pure heroism of '95 lead on to this execrable egoism?</p>

<p>Two friends find themselves side by side with a battery
at the battle of Talavera, one as Captain in command,
the other as lieutenant. A passing bullet lays the
Captain low. "Good," says the lieutenant, quite beside
himself with joy, "that's done for Francis&mdash;now I shall
be Captain." "Not so quick," cries Francis, as he gets
up. He had only been stunned by the bullet. The
lieutenant, as well as the Captain, were the best fellows
in the world, not a bit ill-natured, and only a little stupid;
the excitement of the chase and the furious egoism which
the Emperor had succeeded in awakening, by decorating
it with the name of glory, made these enthusiastic worshippers
of him forget their humanity.</p>

<p>After the harsh spectacle offered by men like this, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>dispute on parade at Schoenbrunn for a look from their
master and a barony&mdash;see how the Emperor's apothecary
describes German love, page 188:</p>

<p>"Nothing can be more sweet, more gentle, than an
Austrian woman. With her, love is a cult, and when she
is attached to a Frenchman, she adores him&mdash;in the full
force of the word.</p>

<p>"There are light, capricious women everywhere, but
in general the Viennese are faithful and in no way
coquettes; when I say that they are faithful, I mean to
the lover of their own choice, for husbands are the same
at Vienna as everywhere else" (June 7, 1809).</p>

<p>The most beautiful woman of Vienna accepts the
homage of one of my friends, M. M&mdash;&mdash;, a captain
attached to the Emperor's headquarters. He's a young
man, gentle and witty, but certainly neither his figure
nor face are in any way remarkable.</p>

<p>For some days past his young mistress has made a very
great sensation among our brilliant staff officers, who
pass their life ferreting about in every corner of Vienna.
It has become a contest of daring. Every possible
manœuvre has been employed. The fair one's house
has been put in a state of siege by all the best-looking and
richest. Pages, brilliant colonels, generals of the guard,
even princes, have gone to waste their time under her
windows, and their money on the fair lady's servants.
All have been turned away. These princes were little
accustomed to find a deaf ear at Paris or Milan. When I
laughed at their discomfiture before this charming
creature: "But good Heavens," she said, "don't they
know that I'm in love with M. M....?"</p>

<p>A singular remark and certainly a most improper one!</p>

<p>Page 290: "While we were at Schoenbrunn I noticed
that two young men, who were attached to the Emperor,
never received anyone in their lodgings at Vienna.
We used to chaff them a lot on their discretion. One
of them said to me one day: 'I'll keep no secrets from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>you: a young woman of the place has given herself
to me, on condition that she need never leave my apartment,
and that I never receive anyone at all without her
leave.' I was curious," says the traveller, "to know
this voluntary recluse, and my position as doctor giving
me, as in the East, an honourable pretext, I accepted a
breakfast offered me by my friend. The woman I found
was very much in love, took the greatest care of the household,
never wanted to go out, though it was just a
pleasant time of the year for walking&mdash;and for the rest,
was quite certain that her lover would take her back
with him to France.</p>

<p>"The other young man, who was also never to be
found in his rooms, soon after made me a similar confession.
I also saw his mistress. Like the first, she was
fair, very pretty, and an excellent figure.</p>

<p>"The one, eighteen years of age, was the daughter of
a well-to-do upholsterer; the other, who was about
twenty-four, was the wife of an Austrian officer, on service
with the army of the Archduke John. This latter pushed
her love to the verge of what we, in our land of vanity,
would call heroism. Not only was her lover faithless to
her, he also found himself under the necessity of making
a confession of a most unpleasant nature. She nursed
him with complete devotion; the seriousness of his
illness attached her to her lover; and perhaps she only
cherished him the more for it, when soon after his life
was in danger.</p>

<p>"It will be understood that I, a stranger and a conqueror,
have had no chance of observing love in the highest
circles, seeing that the whole of the aristocracy of Vienna
had retired at our approach to their estates in Hungary.
But I have seen enough of it to be convinced that it is
not the same love as at Paris.</p>

<p>"The feeling of love is considered by the Germans
as a virtue, as an emanation of the Divinity, as something
mystical. It is riot quick, impetuous, jealous, tyrannical,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>as it is in the heart of an Italian woman: it is profound
and something like illuminism; in this Germany is a
thousand miles away from England.</p>

<p>"Some years ago a Leipsic tailor, in a fit of jealousy,
waited for his rival in the public garden and stabbed
him. He was condemned to lose his head. The moralists
of the town, faithful to the German traditions of kindness
and unhampered emotion (which makes for feebleness
of character) discussed the sentence, decided that
it was severe and, making a comparison between the tailor
and Orosmanes, were moved to pity for his fate. Nevertheless
they were unable to have his sentence mitigated.
But the day of the execution, all the young girls of
Leipsic, dressed in white, met together and accompanied
the tailor to the scaffold, throwing flowers in his path.</p>

<p>"No one thought this ceremony odd; yet, in a country
which considers itself logical, it might be said that it
was honouring a species of murder. But it was a ceremony&mdash;and
everything which is a ceremony, is always
safe from ridicule in Germany. See the ceremonies at
the Courts of the small princes, which would make us
Frenchmen die with laughter, but appear quite imposing
at Meiningen or Koethen. In the six gamekeepers who
file past their little prince, adorned with his star, they
see the soldiers of Arminius marching out to meet the
legions of Varus.</p>

<p>"A point of difference between the Germans and all
other peoples: they are exalted, instead of calming
themselves, by meditation. A second subtle point:
they are all eaten up with the desire to have character.</p>

<p>"Life at Court, ordinarily so favourable to love,
in Germany deadens it. You have no idea of the mass
of incomprehensible <i>minutiæ</i> and the pettinesses that constitute
what is called a German Court,<a name="FNanchor_1_173" id="FNanchor_1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_173" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;even the Court
of the best princes. (Munich, 1820).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>"When we used to arrive with the staff in a German
town, at the end of the first fortnight the ladies of the
district had made their choice. But that choice was
constant; and I have heard it said that the French were
a shoal, on which foundered many a virtue till then
irreproachable."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The young Germans whom I have met at Gottingen,
Dresden, Koenigsberg, etc., are brought up
among pseudo-systems of philosophy, which are merely
obscure and badly written poetry, but, as regards their
ethics, of the highest and holiest sublimity. They seem
to me to have inherited from their Middle Age, not like
the Italians, republicanism, mistrust and the dagger, but
a strong disposition to enthusiasm and good faith. Thus
it is that every ten years they have a new great man who's
going to efface all the others. (Kant, Steding, Fichte, etc.
etc.<a name="FNanchor_2_174" id="FNanchor_2_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_174" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>)</p>

<p>Formerly Luther made a powerful appeal to the moral
sense, and the Germans fought thirty years on end, in
order to obey their conscience. It's a fine word and one
quite worthy of respect, however absurd the belief;
I say worthy of respect even from an artist. See the
struggle in the soul of S&mdash;&mdash; between the third [sixth]
commandment of God&mdash;"Thou shalt not kill"&mdash;and
what he believed to be the interest of his country.</p>

<p>Already in Tacitus we find a mystical enthusiasm for
women and love, at least if that writer was not merely
aiming his satire at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_3_175" id="FNanchor_3_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_175" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>One has not been five hundred miles in Germany,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>before one can distinguish in this people, disunited and
scattered, a foundation of enthusiasm, soft and tender,
rather than ardent and impetuous.</p>

<p>If this disposition were not so apparent, it would be
enough to reread three or four of the novels of Auguste
La Fontaine, whom the pretty Louise, Queen of Prussia,
made Canon of Magdeburg, as a reward for having so
well painted the Peaceful Life.<a name="FNanchor_4_176" id="FNanchor_4_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_176" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I see a new proof of this disposition, which is common
to all the Germans, in the Austrian code, which demands
the confession of the guilty for the punishment of almost
all crimes. This code is calculated to fit a people, among
whom crime is a rare phenomenon, and sooner an excess
of madness in a feeble being than the effect of interests,
daring, reasoned and for ever in conflict with society.
It is precisely the contrary of what is wanted in Italy,
where they are trying to introduce it&mdash;a mistake of well-meaning
people.</p>

<p>I have seen German judges in Italy in despair over
sentences of death or, what's the equivalent, the irons,
if they were obliged to pronounce it without the confession
of the guilty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XLIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">A DAY IN FLORENCE</span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Florence</span>, <i>February</i> 12, 1819.</p>

<p>This evening, in a box at the theatre, I met a man
who had some favour to ask of a magistrate, aged
fifty. His first question was: "Who is his mistress?
<i>Chi avvicina adesso?</i>" Here everyone's affairs are
absolutely public; they have their own laws; there is
an approved manner of acting, which is based on justice
without any conventionality&mdash;if you act otherwise, you
are a <i>porco</i>.</p>

<p>"What's the news?" one of my friends asked yesterday,
on his arrival from Volterra. After a word of
vehement lamentation about Napoleon and the English,
someone adds, in a tone of the liveliest interest: "La
Vitteleschi has changed her lover: poor Gherardesca is
in despair."&mdash;"Whom has she taken?"&mdash;"Montegalli,
the good-looking officer with a moustache, who had
Princess Colonna; there he is down in the stalls, nailed
to her box; he's there the whole evening, because her
husband won't have him in the house, and there near the
door you can see poor Gherardesca, walking about so
sadly and counting afar the glances, which his faithless
mistress throws his successor. He's very changed and
in the depths of despair; it's quite useless for his
friends to try to send him to Paris or London. He is
ready to die, he says, at the very idea of leaving Florence."</p>

<p>Every year there are twenty such cases of despair in
high circles; some of them I have seen last three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>years. These poor devils are without any shame and take
the whole world into their confidence. For the rest,
there's little society here, and besides, when one's in
love, one hardly mixes with it. It must not be thought
that great passions and great hearts are at all common,
even in Italy; only, in Italy, hearts which are more
inflamed and less stunted by the thousand little cares of
our vanity, find delicious pleasures even in the subaltern
species of love. In Italy I have seen love from caprice,
for example, cause transports and moments of madness,
such as the most violent passion has never brought with
it under the meridian of Paris.<a name="FNanchor_1_177" id="FNanchor_1_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_177" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I noticed this evening that there are proper names in
Italian for a million particular circumstances in love,
which, in French, would need endless paraphrases; for
example, the action of turning sharply away, when from
the floor of the house you are quizzing a woman you are
in love with, and the husband or a servant come towards
the front of her box.</p>

<p>The following are the principal traits in the character
of this people:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. The attention, habitually at the service of deep
passions, cannot move rapidly. This is the most marked
difference between a Frenchman and an Italian. You
have only to see an Italian get into a diligence or make a
payment, to understand "la furia francese." It's for
this reason that the most vulgar Frenchman, provided
that he is not a witty fool, like Démasure, always seems
a superior being to an Italian woman. (The lover of
Princess D&mdash;&mdash; at Rome.)</p>

<p>2. Everyone is in love, and not under cover, as in
France; the husband is the best friend of the lover.</p>

<p>3. No one reads.</p>

<p>4. There is no society. A man does not reckon, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>order to fill up and occupy his life, on the happiness
which he derives from two hours' conversation and the
play of vanity in this or that house. The word <i>causerie</i>
cannot be translated into Italian. People speak when
they have something to say, to forward a passion, but
they rarely talk just in order to talk on any given subject.</p>

<p>5. Ridicule does not exist in Italy.</p>

<p>In France, both of us are trying to imitate the same
model, and I am a competent judge of the way in which
you copy it.<a name="FNanchor_2_178" id="FNanchor_2_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_178" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In Italy I cannot say whether the peculiar
action, which I see this man perform, does not give
pleasure to the performer and might not, perhaps, give
pleasure to me.</p>

<p>What is affectation of language or manner at Rome, is
good form or unintelligible at Florence, which is only
fifty leagues away. The same French is spoken at Lyons
as at Nantes. Venetian, Neapolitan Genoese, Piedmontese
are almost entirely different languages, and only spoken
by people who are agreed never to print except in a
common language, namely that spoken at Rome. Nothing
is so absurd as a comedy, with the scene laid at Milan
and the characters speaking Roman. It is only by music
that the Italian language, which is far more fit to be
sung than spoken, will hold its own against the clearness
of French, which threatens it.</p>

<p>In Italy, fear of the "pacha"<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_29">(29)</a></span> and his spies causes
the useful to be held in esteem; the fool's honour simply
doesn't exist.<a name="FNanchor_3_179" id="FNanchor_3_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_179" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Its place is taken by a kind of petty hatred
of society, called "petegolismo." Finally, to make fun
of a person is to make a mortal enemy, a very dangerous
thing in a country where the power and activity of
governments is limited to exacting taxes and punishing
everything above the common level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>6. The patriotism of the antechamber.</p>

<p>That pride which leads a man to seek the esteem of
his fellow-citizens and to make himself one of them, but
which in Italy was cut off, about the year 1550, from any
noble enterprise by the jealous despotism of the small
Italian princes, has given birth to a barbarous product,
to a sort of Caliban, to a monster full of fury and sottishness,
the patriotism of the antechamber, as M. Turgot
called it, <i>à propos</i> of the siege of Calais (the <i>Soldat
laboureur</i><span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_40" id="TNanch_40"></a><a href="#TN_40">(40)</a></span> of those times.) I have seen this monster
blunt the sharpest spirits. For example, a stranger will
make himself unpopular, even with pretty women, if
he thinks fit to find anything wrong with the painter or
poet of the town; he will be soon told, and that very
seriously, that he ought not to come among people to
laugh at them, and they will quote to him on this topic
a saying of Lewis XIV about Versailles.</p>

<p>At Florence people say: "our Benvenuti," as at
Brescia&mdash;"our Arrici": they put on the word "our"
a certain emphasis, restrained yet very comical, not
unlike the <i>Miroir</i> talking with unction about national
music and of M. Monsigny, the musician of Europe.</p>

<p>In order not to laugh in the face of these fine patriots
one must remember that, owing to the dissensions
of the Middle Age, envenomed by the vile policy of the
Popes,<a name="FNanchor_4_180" id="FNanchor_4_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_180" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> each city has a mortal hatred for its neighbour,
and the name of the inhabitants in the one always stands
in the other as a synonym for some gross fault. The
Popes have succeeded in making this beautiful land into
the kingdom of hate.</p>

<p>This patriotism of the antechamber is the greatest
moral sore in Italy, a corrupting germ that will still show
its disastrous effects long after Italy has thrown off the
yoke of its ridiculous little priests.<a name="FNanchor_5_181" id="FNanchor_5_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_181" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The form of this
patriotism is an inexorable hatred for everything foreign.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>Thus they look on the Germans as fools, and get angry
when someone says: "What has Italy in the eighteenth
century produced the equal of Catherine II or Frederick
the Great? Where have you an English garden comparable
to the smallest German garden, you who, with
your climate, have a real need of shade?"</p>

<p>7. Unlike the English or French, the Italians have no
political prejudices; they all know by heart the line of
La Fontaine:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Notre ennemi c'est notre M.<a name="FNanchor_6_182" id="FNanchor_6_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_182" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Aristocracy, supported by the priest and a biblical
state of society, is a worn-out illusion which only
makes them smile. In return, an Italian needs a stay
of three months in France to realise that a draper may be
a conservative.</p>

<p>8. As a last trait of character I would mention intolerance
in discussion, and anger as soon as they do not find
an argument ready to hand, to throw out against that of
their adversary. At that point they visibly turn pale.
It is one form of their extreme sensibility, but it is not
one of its most amiable forms: consequently it is one
of those that I am most willing to admit as proof of
the existence of sensibility.</p>

<p>I wanted to see love without end, and, after considerable
difficulty, I succeeded in being introduced this
evening to Chevalier C&mdash;&mdash; and his mistress, with whom
he has lived for fifty-four years. I left the box of these
charming old people, my heart melted; there I saw the art
of being happy, an art ignored by so many young people.</p>

<p>Two months ago I saw Monsignor R&mdash;&mdash;, by whom I
was well received, because I brought him some copies of
the <i>Minerve</i>. He was at his country house with Madame
D&mdash;&mdash;, whom he is still pleased, after thirty-four years,
"<i>avvicinare</i>," as they say. She is still beautiful, but there
is a touch of melancholy in this household. People
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>attribute it to the loss of a son, who was poisoned long
ago by her husband.</p>

<p>Here, to be in love does not mean, as at Paris, to see
one's mistress for a quarter of an hour every week, and
for the rest of the time to obtain a look or a shake of the
hand: the lover, the happy lover, passes four or five
hours every day with the woman he loves. He talks to
her about his actions at law, his English garden, his
hunting parties, his prospects, etc. There is the completest,
the most tender intimacy. He speaks to her with
the familiar "<i>tu</i>," even in the presence of her husband
and everywhere.</p>

<p>A young man of this country, one very ambitious as
he believed, was called to a high position at Vienna
(nothing less than ambassador). But he could not get
used to his stay abroad. At the end of six months he
said good-bye to his job, and returned to be happy in
his mistress's box at the opera.</p>

<p>Such continual intercourse would be inconvenient in
France, where one must display a certain degree of
affectation, and where your mistress can quite well say
to you: "Monsieur So-and-so, you're glum this evening;
you don't say a word." In Italy it is only a matter of
telling the woman you love everything that passes
through your head&mdash;you must actually think aloud.
There is a certain nervous state which results from intimacy;
freedom provokes freedom, and is only to be
got in this way. But there is one great inconvenience;
you find that love in this way paralyses all your tastes
and renders all the other occupations of your life insipid.
Such love is the best substitute for passion.</p>

<p>Our friends at Paris, who are still at the stage of
trying to conceive that it's possible to be a Persian<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_71" id="TNanch_71"></a><a href="#TN_71">(71)</a></span>,
not knowing what to say, will cry out that such
manners are indecent. To begin with, I am only an
historian; and secondly, I reserve to myself the right to
show one day, by dint of solid reasoning, that as regards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>manners and fundamentally, Paris is not superior to
Bologna. Quite unconsciously these poor people are
still repeating their twopence-halfpenny catechism.</p>

<p>12 <i>July</i>, 1821. There is nothing odious in the society
of Bologna. At Paris the role of a deceived husband is
execrable; here (at Bologna) it is nothing&mdash;there are
no deceived husbands. Manners are the same, it is only
hate that is missing; the recognised lover is always the
husband's friend, and this friendship, which has been
cemented by reciprocal services, quite often survives
other interests. Most love-affairs last five or six years,
many for ever. People part at last, when they no longer
find it sweet to tell each other everything, and when the
first month of the rupture is over, there is no bitterness.</p>

<p><i>January</i>, 1822. The ancient mode of the <i>cavaliere
servente</i>, imported into Italy by Philip II, along with
Spanish pride and manners, has entirely fallen into
disuse in the large towns. I know of only one exception,
and that's Calabria, where the eldest brother always takes
orders, marries his younger brother, sets up in the service
of his sister-in-law and becomes at the same time her
lover.</p>

<p>Napoleon banished libertinism from upper Italy, and
even from here (Naples).</p>

<p>The morals of the present generation of pretty women
shame their mothers; they are more favourable to
passion-love, but physical love has lost a great deal.<a name="FNanchor_7_183" id="FNanchor_7_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_183" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<h3>CHAPTER L<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">LOVE IN THE UNITED STATES<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_41" id="TNanch_41"></a><a href="#TN_41">(41)</a></span></span></h3>


<p>A free government is a government which does no
harm to its citizens, but which, on the contrary,
gives them security and tranquillity. But 'tis a long
cry from this to happiness. That a man must find
for himself; for he must be a gross creature who thinks
himself perfectly happy, because he enjoys security and
tranquillity. We mix these things up in Europe, especially
in Italy. Accustomed as we are to governments,
which do us harm, it seems to us that to be delivered
from them would be supreme happiness; in this we are
like invalids, worn out with the pain of our sufferings.
The example of America shows us just the contrary.
There government discharges its office quite well, and
does harm to no one. But we have been far removed,
for very many centuries, thanks to the unhappy state of
Europe, from any actual experience of the kind, and now
destiny, as if to disconcert and give the lie to all our
philosophy, or rather to accuse it of not knowing all the
elements of human nature, shows us, that just when the
unhappiness of bad government is wanting to America,
the Americans are wanting to themselves.</p>

<p>One is inclined to say that the source of sensibility is
dried up in this people. They are just, they are reasonable,
but they are essentially not happy.</p>

<p>Is the Bible, that is to say, the ridiculous consequences
and rules of conduct which certain fantastic wits deduce
from that collection of poems and songs, sufficient to
cause all this unhappiness? To me it seems a very
considerable effect for such a cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>M. de Volney related that, being at table in the country
at the house of an honest American, a man in easy circumstances,
and surrounded by children already grown
up, there entered into the dining-room a young man.
"Good day, William," said the father of the family;
"sit down." The traveller enquired who this young
man was. "He's my second son." "Where does he
come from?"&mdash;"From Canton."</p>

<p>The arrival of one of his sons from the end of the world
caused no more sensation than that.</p>

<p>All their attention seems employed on finding a reasonable
arrangement of life, and on avoiding all inconveniences.
When finally they arrive at the moment of reaping
the fruit of so much care and of the spirit of order
so long maintained, there is no life left for enjoyment.</p>

<p>One might say that the descendants of Penn never
read that line, which looks like their history:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The young people of both sexes, when winter comes,
which in this country, as in Russia, is the gay season, go
sleighing together day and night over the snow, often
going quite gaily distances of fifteen or twenty miles,
and without anyone to look after them. No inconvenience
ever results from it.</p>

<p>They have the physical gaiety of youth, which soon
passes away with the warmth of their blood, and is over
at twenty-five. But I find no passions which give pleasure.
In America there is such a reasonable habit of
mind that crystallisation has been rendered impossible.</p>

<p>I admire such happiness, but I do not envy it; it is
like the happiness of human beings of a different and
lower species. I augur much better things from Florida
and Southern America.<a name="FNanchor_1_184" id="FNanchor_1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_184" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>What strengthens my conjecture about the North is
the absolute lack of artists and writers. The United
States have not yet<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_42" id="TNanch_42"></a><a href="#TN_42">(42)</a></span> sent us over one scene of a

and one day of pleasure in the seven is a great thing for the agricultural
labourer, who works hard for the other six.</p></div>

<h3>CHAPTER LI<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">LOVE IN PROVENCE UP TO THE CONQUEST OF
TOULOUSE, IN 1328, BY THE BARBARIANS
FROM THE NORTH</span></h3>


<p>Love took a singular form in Provence, from the
year 1100 up to 1328. It had an established
legislation for the relations of the two sexes in love, as
severe and as exactly followed as the laws of Honour
could be to-day. The laws of Love began by putting
completely aside the sacred rights of husbands. They
presuppose no hypocrisy. These laws, taking human
nature such as it is, were of the kind to produce a great
deal of happiness.</p>

<p>There was an official manner of declaring oneself a
woman's lover, and another of being accepted by her as
lover. After so many months of making one's court in
a certain fashion, one obtained her leave to kiss her hand.
Society, still young, took pleasure in formalities and
ceremonies, which were then a sign of civilisation, but
which to-day would bore us to death. The same trait
is to be found in the language of Provence, in the difficulty
and interlacing of its rhymes, in its masculine and
feminine words to express the same object, and indeed
in the infinite number of its poets. Everything formal
in society, which is so insipid to-day, then had all the
freshness and savour of novelty.</p>

<p>After having kissed a woman's hand, one was promoted
from grade to grade by force of merit, and without
extraordinary promotion.</p>

<p>It should be remarked, however, that if the husbands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>were always left out of the question, on the other hand
the official promotion of the lover stopped at what we
should call the sweetness of a most tender friendship
between persons of a different sex.<a name="FNanchor_1_185" id="FNanchor_1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_185" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But after several
months or several years of probation, in which a woman
might become perfectly sure of the character and discretion
of a man, and he enjoy at her hand all the
prerogatives and outward signs which the tenderest
friendship can give, her virtue must surely have had
to thank his friendship for many a violent alarm.</p>

<p>I have spoken of extraordinary promotion, because a
woman could have more than one lover, but one only in
the higher grades. It seems that the rest could not be
promoted much beyond that degree of friendship which
consisted in kissing her hand and seeing her every day.
All that is left to us of this singular civilisation is in verse,
and in a verse that is rhymed in a very fantastic and
difficult way; and it need not surprise us if the notions,
which we draw from the ballads of the troubadours, are
vague and not at all precise. Even a marriage contract
in verse has been found. After the conquest in 1328,
as a result of its heresy, the Pope, on several occasions,
ordered everything written in the vulgar tongue to be
burnt. Italian cunning proclaimed Latin the only
language worthy of such clever people. 'Twere a most
advantageous measure could we renew it in 1822.</p>

<p>Such publicity and such official ordering of love seem
at first sight to ill-accord with real passion. But if a
lady said to her lover: "Go for your love of me and
visit the tomb of our Lord Jesus Christ at Jerusalem;
there you will pass three years and then return"&mdash;the
lover was gone immediately: to hesitate a moment
would have covered him with the same ignominy as
would nowadays a sign of wavering on a point of honour.
The language of this people has an extreme fineness in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>expressing the most fugitive shades of feeling. Another
sign that their manners were well advanced on the road
of real civilisation is that, scarcely out of the horrors
of the Middle Ages and of Feudalism, when force was
everything, we see the feebler sex less tyrannised over
than it is to-day with the approval of the law; we see
the poor and feeble creatures, who have the most to
lose in love and whose charms disappear the quickest,
mistresses over the destiny of the men who approach
them. An exile of three years in Palestine, the passage
from a civilisation full of gaiety to the fanaticism and
boredom of the Crusaders' camp, must have been a
painful duty for any other than an inspired Christian.
What can a woman do to her lover who has basely
deserted her at Paris?</p>

<p>I can only see one answer to be made here: at Paris no
self-respecting woman has a lover. Certainly prudence
has much more right to counsel the woman of to-day not
to abandon herself to passion-love. But does not another
prudence, which, of course, I am far from approving,
counsel her to make up for it with physical love? Our
hypocrisy and asceticism<a name="FNanchor_2_186" id="FNanchor_2_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_186" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> imply no homage to virtue;
for you can never oppose nature with impunity: there
is only less happiness on earth and infinitely less generous
inspiration.</p>

<p>A lover who, after ten years of intimate intercourse,
deserted his poor mistress, because he began to notice
her two-and-thirty years, was lost to honour in this
lovable Provence; he had no resource left but to bury
himself in the solitude of a cloister. In those days it
was to the interest of a man, not only of generosity but
even of prudence, to make display of no more passion
than he really had. We conjecture all this; for very
few remains are left to give us any exact notions....</p>

<p>We must judge manners as a whole, by certain particular
facts. You know the anecdote of the poet who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>had offended his lady: after two years of despair she
deigned at last to answer his many messages and let him
know that if he had one of his nails torn off and had this
nail presented to her by fifty loving and faithful knights,
she might perhaps pardon him. The poet made all haste
to submit to the painful operation. Fifty knights, who
stood in their ladies' good graces, went to present this
nail with all imaginable pomp to the offended beauty.
It was as imposing a ceremony as the entry of a prince
of the blood into one of the royal towns. The lover,
dressed in the garb of a penitent, followed his nail from
afar. The lady, after having watched the ceremony,
which was of great length, right through, deigned to
pardon him; he was restored to all the sweets of his
former happiness. History tells that they spent long
and happy years together. Sure it is that two such years
of unhappiness prove a real passion and would have
given birth to it, had it not existed before in that high
degree.</p>

<p>I could cite twenty anecdotes which show us everywhere
gallantry, pleasing, polished and conducted between
the two sexes on principles of justice. I say gallantry,
because in all ages passion-love is an exception, rather
curious than frequent, a something we cannot reduce to
rules. In Provence every calculation, everything within
the domain of reason, was founded on justice and the
equality of rights between the two sexes; and I admire
it for this reason especially, that it eliminates unhappiness
as far as possible. The absolute monarchy under Lewis
XV, on the contrary, had come to make baseness and
perfidy the fashion in these relations.<a name="FNanchor_3_187" id="FNanchor_3_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_187" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Although this charming Provencal language, so full of
delicacy and so laboured in its rhymes,<a name="FNanchor_4_188" id="FNanchor_4_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_188" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was probably not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>the language of the people, the manners of the upper
classes had permeated the lower classes, which in Provence
were at that time far from coarse, for they enjoyed
a great deal of comfort. They were in the first enjoyment
of a very prosperous and very valuable trade. The inhabitants
of the shores of the Mediterranean had just
realised (in the ninth century) that to engage in commerce,
by risking a few ships on this sea, was less troublesome
and almost as amusing as following some little
feudal lord and robbing the passers-by on the neighbouring
high-road. Soon after, the Provencals of the tenth
century learnt from the Arabs that there are sweeter
pleasures than pillage, violence and war.</p>

<p>One must think of the Mediterranean as the home of
European civilisation. The happy shores of this lovely
sea, so favoured in its climate, were still more favoured
in the prosperous state of their inhabitants and in the
absence of all religion or miserable legislation. The
eminently gay genius of the Provencals had by then
passed through the Christian religion, without being
altered by it.</p>

<p>We see a lively image of a like effect from a like cause
in the cities of Italy, whose history has come down to us
more distinctly and which have had the good fortune
besides of bequeathing to us Dante, Petrarch and the
art of painting.</p>

<p>The Provencals have not left us a great poem like
the <i>Divine Comedy</i>, in which are reflected all the
peculiarities of the manners of the time. They had, it
seems to me, less passion and much more gaiety than the
Italians. They learnt this pleasant way of taking life
from their neighbours, the Moors of Spain. Love
reigned with joy, festivity and pleasure in the castles of
happy Provence.</p>

<p>Have you seen at the opera the finale of one of Rossini's
beautiful operettas? On the stage all is gaiety, beauty,
ideal magnificence. We are miles away from all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>mean side of human nature. The opera is over, the
curtain falls, the spectators go out, the great chandelier
is drawn up, the lights are extinguished. The house is
filled with the smell of lamps hastily put out; the
curtain is pulled up half-way, and you see dirty, ill-dressed
roughs tumble on to the stage; they bustle about
it in a hideous way, occupying the place of the young
women who filled it with their graces only a moment
ago.</p>

<p>Such for the kingdom of Provence was the effect of
the conquest of Toulouse by the army of Crusaders.
Instead of love, of grace, of gaiety, we have the Barbarians
from the North and Saint Dominic. I shall not
darken these pages with a blood-curdling account of the
horrors of the Inquisition in all the zeal of its early days.
As for the Barbarians, they were our fathers; they
killed and plundered everywhere; they destroyed, for
the pleasure of destroying, whatever they could not
carry off; a savage madness animated them against
everything that showed the least trace of civilisation;
above all, they understood not a word of that beautiful
southern language; and that redoubled their fury.
Highly superstitious and guided by the terrible S. Dominic,
they thought to gain Heaven by killing the Provencals.
For the latter all was over; no more love, no more gaiety,
no more poetry. Less than twenty years after the conquest
(1335), they were almost as barbarous and as coarse
as the French, as our fathers.<a name="FNanchor_5_189" id="FNanchor_5_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_189" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Whence had lighted on this corner of the world that
charming form of civilisation, which for two centuries
was the happiness of the upper classes of society?
Apparently from the Moors of Spain.</p>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">PROVENCE IN THE TWELFTH CENTURY</span></h3>


<p>I am going to translate an anecdote from the Provençal
manuscripts. The facts, of which you are
going to read, happened about the year 1180 and the
history was written about 1250.<a name="FNanchor_1_190" id="FNanchor_1_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_190" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The anecdote, to be
sure, is very well known: the style especially gives the
colour of the society which produced it.</p>

<p>I beg that I be allowed to translate it word for word,
and without seeking in any way after the elegance of the
language of to-day.</p>

<p>"My Lord Raymond of Roussillon was a valiant baron,
as you know, and he took to wife my Lady Marguerite,
the most beautiful woman of all her time and one of
the most endowed with all good qualities, with all worth
and with all courtesy. Now it happened that William
of Cabstaing came to the Court of my Lord Raymond of
Roussillon, presented himself to him and begged, if it
so pleased him, that he might be a page in his Court.
My Lord Raymond, who saw that he was fair and of
good grace, told him that he was welcome and that
he might dwell at his Court. Thus William dwelt with
him, and succeeded in bearing himself so gently that
great and small loved him; and he succeeded in placing
himself in so good a light that my Lord Raymond wished
him to be page to my Lady Marguerite, his wife; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>so it was. Then William set himself to merit yet more
both in word and deed. But now, as is wont to happen
in love, it happened that Love wished to take hold of my
Lady Marguerite and to inflame her thoughts. So much
did the person of William please her, both his word and
his air, that one day she could not restrain herself from
saying to him: 'Now listen, William, if a woman showed
you likelihood of love, tell me would you dare love her
well?' 'Yes, that I would, madam, provided only
that the likelihood were the truth.'&mdash;'By S. John,' said
the lady, 'you have answered well, like a man of valour;
but at present I wish to try you, whether you can understand
and distinguish in matter of likelihood the difference
between what is true and what is not.'</p>

<p>"When William heard these words he answered: 'My
lady, it is as it shall please you.'</p>

<p>"He began to be pensive, and at once Love sought
war with him; and the thoughts that love mingled with
his entered into the depth of his heart, and straightway
he was of the servants of Love and began to 'find'<a name="FNanchor_2_191" id="FNanchor_2_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_191" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> little
couplets, gracious and gay, and tunes for the dance and
tunes with sweet words,<a name="FNanchor_3_192" id="FNanchor_3_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_192" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by which he was well received,
and the more so by reason of her for whom he sang.
Now Love, that grants to his servants their reward,
when he pleases, wished to grant William the price of
his; and behold, he began to take hold of the lady with
such keen thoughts and meditations on love that neither
night nor day could she rest, thinking of the valour and
prowess that had been so beautifully disposed and set
in William.</p>

<p>"One day it happened that the lady took William and
said to him: 'William, come now, tell me, have you up
to this hour taken note of our likelihood, whether it truly
is or lies?' William answered: 'My lady, so help me
God, from that moment onward that I have been your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>servant, no thought has been able to enter my heart
but that you were the best woman that was ever born,
and the truest in the world and the most likely. So I
think, and shall think, all my life.' And the lady answered:
'William, I tell you that, if God help me, you
shall never be deceived by me, and that what you think
shall not prove vain or nothing.' And she opened her
arms and kissed him softly in the room where they two
sat together, and they began their "<i>druerie</i>";<a name="FNanchor_4_193" id="FNanchor_4_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_193" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
straightway there wanted not those, whom God holds
in wrath, who set themselves to talk and gossip of their
love, by reason of the songs that William made, saying
that he had set his love on my Lady Marguerite, and so
indiscriminately did they talk that the matter came to
the ears of my Lord Raymond. Then he was sorely
pained and grievously sad, first that he must lose his
familiar squire, whom he loved so well, and more still for
his wife's shame.</p>

<p>"One day it happened that William went out to hunt
with his hawks and a single squire; and my Lord Raymond
made enquiry where he was; and a groom answered
him that he had gone out to hawk, and one who
knew added that it was in such-and-such a spot. Immediately
Raymond took arms, which he hid, and had
his horse brought to him, and all alone took his way
towards the spot whither William had gone: by dint of
hard riding he found him. When William saw him
approach he was greatly astonished, and at once evil
thoughts came to him, and he advanced to meet him
and said: 'My lord, welcome. Why are you thus alone?'
My Lord Raymond answered: 'William, because I have
come to find you to enjoy myself with you. Have you
caught anything?'&mdash;'I have caught nothing, my lord,
because I have found nothing; and he who finds little
will not catch much, as the saying goes.'&mdash;'Enough of
this talk,' said my Lord Raymond, 'and by the faith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>you owe me, tell me the truth on all the questions that
I may wish to ask.'&mdash;'By God, my lord,' said William,
'if there is ought to say, certainly to you shall I say it.'
Then said my Lord Raymond: 'I wish for no subtleties
here, but you must answer me in all fullness on everything
that I shall ask you.'&mdash;'My lord, as it shall please you to
ask,' said William, 'so shall I tell you the truth.' And
my Lord Raymond asked: 'William, as you value God
and the holy faith, have you a mistress for whom you
sing and for whom Love constrains you?' William
answered: 'My lord, and how else should I be singing, if
Love did not urge me on? Know the truth, my lord,
that Love has me wholly in his power.' Raymond
answered: 'I can well believe it, for otherwise you
could not sing so well; but I wish to know, if you please,
who is your lady.'&mdash;'Ah, my lord, in God's name,' said
William, 'see what you ask me. You know too well
that a man must not name his lady, and that Bernard of
Ventadour says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'In one thing my reason serves me,<a name="FNanchor_5_194" id="FNanchor_5_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_194" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i1">That never man has asked me of my joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But I have lied to him thereof willingly.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For this does not seem to me good doctrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But rather folly or a child's act,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That whoever is well treated in love<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Should wish to open his heart thereon to another man,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Unless he can serve him or help him.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"My Lord Raymond answered: 'And I give you my
word that I will serve you according to my power.' So
said Raymond, and William answered him: 'My lord,
you must know that I love the sister of my Lady Marguerite,
your wife, and that I believe I have exchange
with her of love. Now that you know it, I beg you to
come to my aid and at least not to prejudice me.'&mdash;'Take
my word,' said Raymond, 'for I swear to you and engage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>myself to you that I will use all my power for you.'
And then he gave his word, and when he had given it
to him Raymond said to him: 'I wish us to go to her
castle, for it is near by.'&mdash;'And I beg we may do so, in
God's name,' said William. And so they took their road
towards the castle of Liet. And when they came to
the castle they were well received by <i>En</i><a name="FNanchor_6_195" id="FNanchor_6_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_195" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Robert of
Tarascon, who was the husband of my Lady Agnes, the
sister of my Lady Marguerite, and by my Lady Agnes
herself. And my Lord Raymond took my Lady Agnes
by the hand and led her into her chamber, and they sat
down on the bed. And my Lord Raymond said: 'Now
tell me, my sister-in-law, by the faith that you owe me,
are you in love with Love?' And she said: 'Yes, my
lord.'&mdash;'And whose?' said he. 'Oh, that I do not
tell you,' answered she; 'what means this parleying?'</p>

<p>"In the end, so insistently did he demand that she
said that she loved William of Cabstaing; this she said
because she saw William sad and pensive and she knew
well that he loved her sister; and so she feared that
Raymond might have had evil thoughts of William. Such
a reply gave great joy to Raymond. Agnes related it all
to her husband, and her husband answered her that she
had done well and gave her his word that she was at
liberty to do and say anything that could save William.
Agnes was not wanting to him. She called William all
alone into her chamber, and remained so long with him
that Raymond thought he must have had the pleasures
of love with her; and all this pleased him, and he began
to think that what he had been told of William was untrue
and random talk. Agnes and William came out of
her chamber, supper was prepared and they supped with
great gaiety. And after supper Agnes had the bed of
her two neighbours prepared by the door of her chamber,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>and so well did the Lady and William act their parts
that Raymond believed he was with her.</p>

<p>"And the next day they dined in the castle with great
joy, and after dinner they set out with all the honours
of a noble leave-taking, and came to Roussillon. And as
soon as Raymond could, he separated from William and
went away to his wife, and related to her all that he had
seen of William and her sister, for which his wife was
sorely grieved all night. And the next day she had
William summoned to her and received him ill, and called
him false friend and traitor. And William cried to her
for pity, as a man who had done nought of that with
which she charged him, and related to her all that had
passed, word for word. And the lady sent for her sister
and from her she learnt that William had done no wrong.
And therefore she called him and bade him make a song
by which he should show that he loved no woman but
her, and then he made the song which says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sweet thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That Love often gives me.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"And when Raymond of Roussillon heard the song
that William had made for his wife, he made him come
to speak with him some way from the castle, and cut
off his head, which he put in a bag; he drew out the heart
from the body and put it with the head. He went back
to the castle; he had the heart roasted and brought to
his wife at table and made her eat it without her knowing.
When she had eaten it, Raymond rose up and told his
wife that what she had just eaten was the heart of Lord
William of Cabstaing, and showed her his head and asked
her if the heart had been good to eat. And she heard
what he said, and saw and recognised the head of Lord
William. She answered him and said that the heart
had been so good and savoury, that never other meat or
other drink could take away from her mouth the taste
that the heart of Lord William had left there. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>Raymond ran at her with a sword. She took to flight,
threw herself down from a balcony and broke her head.</p>

<p>"This became known through all Catalonia and through
all the lands of the King of Aragon. King Alphonse and all
the barons of these countries had great grief and sorrow
for the death of Lord William and of the woman whom
Raymond had so basely done to death. They made war
on him with fire and sword. King Alphonse of Aragon
having taken Raymond's castle, had William and his
lady laid in a monument before the door of a church in
a borough named Perpignac. All perfect lovers of either
sex prayed God for their souls. The King of Aragon
took Raymond and let him die in prison, and gave all his
goods to the relatives of William and to the relatives of
the woman who died for him."</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">ARABIA</span></h3>


<p>'Tis beneath the dusky tent of the Bedouin Arab
that we seek the model and the home of true
love. There, as elsewhere, solitude and a fine climate
have kindled the noblest passion of the human heart&mdash;that
passion which must give as much happiness as it
feels, in order to be happy itself.</p>

<p>In order that love may be seen in all the fullness of its
power over the human heart, equality must be established
as far as possible between the mistress and her lover. It
does not exist, this equality, in our poor West; a woman
deserted is unhappy or dishonoured. Under the Arab's
tent faith once plighted cannot be broken. Contempt
and death immediately follow that crime.</p>

<p>Generosity is held so sacred by this people, that you
may steal, in order to give. For the rest, every day
danger stares them in the face, and life flows on ever, so
to speak, in a passionate solitude. Even in company the
Arabs speak little.</p>

<p>Nothing changes for the inhabitant of the desert;
there everything is eternal and motionless. This singular
mode of life, of which, owing to my ignorance, I can give
but a poor sketch, has probably existed since the time of
Homer.<a name="FNanchor_1_196" id="FNanchor_1_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_196" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It is described for the first time about the year
600 of our era, two centuries before Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Clearly it is we who were the barbarians in the eyes of
the East, when we went to trouble them with our
crusades.<a name="FNanchor_2_197" id="FNanchor_2_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_197" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Also we owe all that is in our manner to these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>crusades and to the Moors of Spain. If we compare
ourselves with the Arabs, the proud, prosaic man will
smile with pity. Our arts are very much superior to
theirs, our systems of law to all appearance still more
superior. But I doubt if we beat them in the art
of domestic happiness&mdash;we have always lacked loyalty
and simplicity. In family relations the deceiver is the
first to suffer. For him the feeling of safety is departed;
always unjust, he is always afraid.</p>

<p>In the earliest of their oldest historical monuments we
can see the Arabs divided from all antiquity into a large
number of independent tribes, wandering about the
desert. As soon as these tribes were able to supply, with
more or less ease, the simplest human wants, their way of
life was already more or less refined. Generosity was
the same on every side; only according to the tribe's
degree of wealth it found expression, now in the quarter
of goat's flesh necessary for the support of life, now in
the gift of a hundred camels, occasioned by some family
connexion or reasons of hospitality.</p>

<p>The heroic age of the Arabs, that in which these
generous hearts burnt unsullied by any affectation of fine
wit or refined sentiment, was that which preceded
Mohammed; it corresponds to the fifth century of
our era, to the foundations of Venice and to the reign
of Clovis. I beg European pride to compare the Arab
love-songs, which have come down to us, and the noble
system of life revealed in the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>,
with the disgusting horrors that stain every page of
Gregory of Tours, the historian of Clovis, and of Eginhard,
the historian of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>Mohammed was a puritan; he wished to prescribe
pleasures which do no one any harm; he has killed love
in those countries which have accepted Islamism.<a name="FNanchor_3_198" id="FNanchor_3_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_198" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It
is for this reason that his religion has always been less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>observed in Arabia, its cradle, than in all the other
Mohammedan countries.</p>

<p>The French brought away from Egypt four folio
volumes, entitled <i>The Book of Songs</i>. These volumes
contain:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Biographies of the poets who composed the songs.</p>

<p>2. The songs themselves. In them the poet sings of
everything that interests him; when he has spoken of
his mistress he praises his swiftcoursers and his bow. These
songs were often love-letters from their author, giving
the object of his love a faithful picture of all that passed
in his heart. Sometimes they tell of cold nights when he
has been obliged to burn his bow and arrows. The Arabs
are a nation without houses.</p>

<p>3. Biographies of the musicians who have composed
the music for these songs.</p>

<p>4. Finally, the notation of the musical setting; for us
these settings are hieroglyphics. The music will be for
ever unknown, and anyhow, it would not please us.</p>

<p>There is another collection entitled <i>The History of
those Arabs who have died for Love</i>.</p>

<p>In order to feel at home in the midst of remains which
owe so much of their interest to their antiquity, and to
appreciate the singular beauty of the manners of which
they let us catch a glimpse, we must go to history for
enlightenment on certain points.</p>

<p>From all time, and especially before Mohammed, the
Arabs betook themselves to Mecca in order to make the
tour of the Caaba or house of Abraham. I have seen at
London a very exact model of the Holy City. There are
seven or eight hundred houses with terraces on the roofs,
set in the midst of a sandy desert devoured by the sun.
At one extremity of the city is found an immense
building, in form almost a square; this building surrounds
the Caaba. It is composed of a long course of colonnades,
necessary under an Arabian sun for the performance
of the sacred procession, This colonnade is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>important in the history of the manners and poetry of
the Arabs; it was apparently for centuries the one place
where men and women met together. Pell-mell, with
slow steps, and reciting in chorus their sacred songs,
they walked round the Caaba&mdash;it is a walk of three-quarters
of an hour. The procession was repeated many
times in the same day; this was the sacred rite for which
men and women came forth from all parts of the desert.
It is under the colonnade of the Caaba that Arab manners
became polished. A contest between the father and the
lover soon came to be established&mdash;in love-lyrics the
lover discovered his passion to the girl, jealously guarded
by brothers and father, as at her side he walked in the
sacred procession. The generous and sentimental habits
of this people existed already in the camp; but Arab
gallantry seems to me to have been born in the shadow
of the Caaba, which is also the home of their literature.
At first, passion was expressed with simplicity and vehemence,
just as the poet felt it; later the poet, instead of
seeking to touch his mistress, aimed at fine writing;
then followed that affectation which the Moors introduced
into Spain and which still to-day spoils the books
of that people.<a name="FNanchor_4_199" id="FNanchor_4_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_199" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>I find a touching proof of the Arab's respect for the
weaker sex in his ceremony of divorce. The woman,
during the absence of her husband from whom she
wished to separate, opened the tent and drew it up,
taking care to place the opening on the opposite side to
that which she had formerly occupied. This simple ceremony
separated husband and wife for ever.</p>

Gathered and translated from an Arabic Collection entitled:
<i>The Divan of Love</i><span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_39">(39)</a></span><br />

Compiled by Ebn-Abi-Hadglat. (Manuscripts
of the King's Library, Nos. 1461 and 1462.)</p>

<p>Mohammed, son of Djaafar Elahouazadi, relates
that Djamil being sick of the illness of which he
died, Elabas, son of Sohail, visited him and found
him ready to give up the ghost. "O son of Sohail," said
Djamil to him, "what do you think of a man who has
never drunk wine, who has never made illicit gain, who
has never unrighteously given death to any living creature
that God has forbidden us to kill, and who confesses
that there is no other God but Allah and that Mohammed
is his prophet?" "I think," answered Ben Sohail,
"that such a man will be saved and will gain Paradise;
but who is he, this man of whom you talk?" "'Tis I,"
answered Djamil. "I did not think that you professed
the faith," returned Ben Sohail, "and moreover, for
twenty years now you have been making love to Bothaina,
and celebrating her in your verses." "Here I am,"
answered Djamil, "at my first day in the other world
and at my last in this, and I pray that the mercy of
our Master Mohammed may not be extended to me
at the day of judgment, if ever I have laid hands on
Bothaina for anything reprehensible."</p>

<p>This Djamil and Bothaina, his mistress, both belonged
to the Benou-Azra, who are a tribe famous in love among
all the tribes of the Arabs. Also their manner of loving
has passed into a proverb, and God has made no other
creatures as tender in love as they.</p>

<p>Sahid, son of Agba, one day asked an Arab: "Of what
people are you?" "I am of the people that die when
they love," replied the Arab. "Then you are of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>tribe of Azra," added Sahid. "Yes, by the Master of
the Caaba," replied the Arab. "Whence comes it that
you love in this manner?" Sahid asked next. "Our
women are beautiful and our young men are chaste,"
answered the Arab.</p>

<p>One day someone asked Aroua-Ben-Hezam:<a name="FNanchor_5_200" id="FNanchor_5_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_200" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "Is it
really true what people tell of you, that you of all mankind
have the heart most tender in love?" "Yes, by
Allah, it is true," answered Aroua, "and I have known
in my tribe thirty young men whom death has carried
oil and who had no other sickness but love."</p>

<p>An Arab of the Benou-Fazarat said one day to an Arab
of the Benou-Azra: "You, Benou-Azra, you think it a
sweet and noble death to die of love; but therein is a
manifest weakness and stupidity; and those whom you
take for men of great heart are only madmen and soft
creatures." "You would not talk like that," the Arab
of the tribe of Azra answered him, "if you had seen
the great black eyes of our women darting fire from
beneath the veil of their long lashes, if you had seen them
smile and their teeth gleaming between their brown lips!"</p>

<p>Abou-el-Hassan, Ali, son of Abdalla, Elzagouni, relates
the following story: A Mussulman loved to distraction
the daughter of a Christian. He was obliged to make a
journey to a foreign country with a friend, to whom he
had confided his love. His business prolonged his stay
in this country, and being attacked there by a mortal
sickness, he said to his friend: "Behold, my time approaches;
no more in the world shall I meet her whom
I love, and I fear, if I die a Mussulman, that I shall not
meet her again in the other life." He turned Christian
and died. His friend betook himself to the young
Christian woman, whom he found sick. She said to him:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>"I shall not see my friend any more in this world, but
I want to be with him in the other; therefore I confess
that there is no other God but Allah, and that Mohammed
is the prophet of God." Thereupon she died, and may
God's mercy be upon her.*</p>

<p>Eltemimi relates that there was in the tribe of the
Arabs of Tagleb a Christian girl of great riches who was
in love with a young Mussulman. She offered him her
fortune and all her treasures without succeeding in
making him love her. When she had lost all hope she
gave an artist a hundred dinars, to make her a statue of
the young man she loved. The artist made the statue,
and when the girl got it, she placed it in a certain spot
where she went every day. There she would begin by
kissing this statue, and then sat down beside it and spent
the rest of the day in weeping. When the evening came
she would bow to the statue and retire. This she did
for a long time. The young man chanced to die; she
desired to see him and to embrace him dead, after which
she returned to her statue, bowed to it, kissed it as usual,
and lay down beside it. When day came, they found her
dead, stretching out her hand towards some lines of
writing, which she had written before she died.*</p>

<p>Oueddah, of the land of Yamen, was renowned among
the Arabs for his beauty. He and Om-el-Bonain, daughter
of Abd-el-Aziz, son of Merouan, while still only children,
were even then so much in love that they could not bear
to be parted from each other for a moment. When
Om-el-Bonain became the wife of Oualid-Ben-Abd-el-Malek,
Oueddah became mad for grief. After remaining
a long time in a state of distraction and suffering, he
betook himself to Syria and began every day to prowl
around the house of Oualid, son of Malek, without at
first finding the means to attain his desire. In the end,
he made the acquaintance of a girl, whom he succeeded
in attaching to himself by dint of his perseverance and
his pains. When he thought he could rely on her, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>asked her if she knew Om-el-Bonain. "To be sure I
do," answered the girl, "seeing she is my mistress."
"Listen," continued Oueddah, "your mistress is my
cousin, and if you care to tell her about me, you will
certainly give her pleasure." "I'll tell her willingly,"
answered the girl. And thereupon she ran straight to
Om-el-Bonain to tell her about Oueddah. "Take care
what you say," cried Om-el-Bonain. "What? Oueddah
is alive?" "Certainly he is," said the girl. "Go and
tell him," Om-el-Bonain went on, "on no account to
depart until a messenger comes to him from me." Then
she took measures to get Oueddah brought to her, where
she kept him hidden in a coffer. She let him come out
to be with her when she thought it safe; but if someone
arrived who might have seen him, she made him get
inside the coffer again.</p>

<p>It happened one day that a pearl was brought to Oualid
and he said to one of his attendants: "Take this pearl
and give it to Om-el-Bonain." The attendant took the
pearl and gave it to Om-el-Bonain. As he was not
announced, he entered where she dwelt at a time when
she was with Oueddah, and thus he was able to throw a
glance into Om-el-Bonain's apartment without her
noticing him. Oualid's attendant fulfilled his mission
and asked something of Om-el-Bonain for the jewel he
had brought her. She refused him with severity and
reprimanded him. The attendant went out incensed
against her, and went to tell Oualid what he had seen,
describing the coffer into which he had seen Oueddah
enter. "You lie, bastard slave! You lie," said Oualid.
And he ran in haste to Om-el-Bonain. There were
several coffers in her apartment; he sat down on the
one in which Oueddah was hid and which the slave had
described, saying: "Give me one of these coffers."
"They are all yours, as much as I myself," answered
Om-el-Bonain. "Then," continued Oualid, "I would
like to have the one on which I am seated." "There are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>some things in it that only a woman needs," said Om-el-Bonain.
"It is not them, it is the coffer I desire," added
Oualid. "It is yours," she answered. Oualid had the
coffer taken away at once, and summoned two slaves,
whom he ordered to dig a pit in the earth down to the
depth where they would find water. Then placing his
mouth against the coffer: "I have heard something of
you," he cried. "If I have heard the truth, may all
trace of you be lost, may all memory of you be buried.
If they have told me false I do no harm by entombing
a coffer: it is only the funeral of a box." Then he had
the coffer pushed into the pit and covered with the
stones and the earth which had been dug up. From that
time Om-el-Bonain never ceased to frequent this spot
and to weep, until one day they found her there lifeless,
her face pressed towards the earth.*<a name="FNanchor_6_201" id="FNanchor_6_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_201" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN</span></h3>


<p>In the actual education of girls, which is the fruit
of chance and the most idiotic pride, we allow their
most shining faculties, and those most fertile in happiness
for themselves and for us, to lie fallow. But what man
is there, who at least once in his life has not exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">... a woman always knows enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If but her range of understanding reaches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To telling one from t'other, coat and breeches.<br /></span>
<span class="i14">(<i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>, Act II, Scene VII.)<br /></span>
<span class="i18">[Translation of C. H. Page, New York, 1908.]<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Paris, this is the highest praise for a young girl of
a marriageable age: "There is so much that's sweet in
her character, and she's as gentle as a lamb." Nothing
has more effect on the idiots looking out for wives. But
see them two years later, lunching <i>tête-à-tête</i> with their
wives some dull day, hats on and surrounded by three
great lackeys!</p>

<p>We have seen a law carried in the United States, in
1818, which condemns to thirty-four strokes of the cat
anyone teaching a Virginian negro to read.<a name="FNanchor_1_202" id="FNanchor_1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_202" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Nothing
could be more consequent and more reasonable than a
law of this kind.</p>

<p>Were the United States of America themselves more
useful to the motherland when they were her slaves or
since they have become her equals? If the work of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>free man is worth two or three times that of a man
reduced to slavery, why should not the same be true of
that man's thought?</p>

<p>If we dared, we would give girls the education of a
slave; and the proof of this is that if they know anything
useful, it is against our wish we teach it them.</p>

<p>"But they turn against us the little education which
unhappily they get hold of," some husbands might say.
No doubt; and Napoleon was also quite right not to
give arms to the National Guard; and the reactionaries
are also quite right to proscribe the monitorial system<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_44" id="TNanch_44"></a><a href="#TN_44">(44)</a></span>.
Arm a man, and then continue to oppress him, and you
will see that he can be so perverse as to turn his arms
against you, as soon as he can.</p>

<p>Even if it were permissible to bring girls up like idiots,
on <i>Ave Marias</i> and lewd songs, as they did in the convents
of 1770, there would still be several little objections:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. In the case of the husband's death, they are called
upon to manage the young family.</p>

<p>2. As mothers, they give their male children, the young
tyrants of the future, their first education, that education
which forms the character, and accustoms the soul
to seek happiness by this route rather than by that&mdash;and
the choice is always an accomplished fact by four or
five.</p>

<p>3. In spite of all our pride, the advice of the inevitable
partner of our whole life has great influence on those
domestic affairs on which our happiness depends so
particularly; for, in the absence of passion, happiness is
based on the absence of small everyday vexations. Not
that we would willingly accord this advice the least
influence, but she may repeat the same thing to us for
twenty years together. Whose is the spirit of such
Roman fortitude as to resist the same idea repeated
throughout a whole lifetime? The world is full of
husbands who let themselves be led, but it is from weakness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>and not from a feeling for justice and equality. As
they yield perforce, the wife is always tempted to abuse
her power, and it is sometimes necessary to abuse power
in order to keep it.</p>

<p>4. Finally, in love, and during a period which, in
southern countries, often comprises twelve or fifteen years,
and those the fairest of our life, our happiness is entirely
in the hands of the woman we love. One moment of
untimely pride can make us for ever miserable, and how
should a slave raised up to a throne not be tempted to
abuse her power? This is the origin of women's false
refinement and pride. Of course, there is nothing more
useless than these pleas: men are despots and we see
what respect other despots show to the wisest counsels.
A man who is all-powerful relishes only one sort of advice,
the advice of those that tell him to increase his power.
Where are poor young girls to find a Quiroga or a Riego<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_45" id="TNanch_45"></a><a href="#TN_45">(45)</a></span>
to give the despots, who oppress them, and degrade
them the better to oppress them, that salutary advice,
whose just recompense are favours and orders instead of
Porlier's<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_45">(45)</a></span> gallows?</p>

<p>If a revolution of this kind needs several centuries, it
is because, by a most unlucky chance, all our first experiences
must necessarily contradict the truth. Illuminate
a girl's mind, form her character, give her, in short, a
good education in the true sense of the word&mdash;remarking
sooner or later her own superiority over other women, she
becomes a pedant, that is to say, the most unpleasant and
the most degraded creature that there is in the world.
There isn't one of us who wouldn't prefer a servant to a
<i>savante</i>, if we had to pass our life with her.</p>

<p>Plant a young tree in the midst of a dense forest,
deprived of air and sun by the closeness of the neighbouring
trees: its leaves will be blighted, and it will get
an overgrown and ridiculous shape&mdash;<i>not</i> its natural
shape. We ought to plant the whole forest at once. What
woman is there who is proud of knowing how to read?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>Pedants have repeated to us for two thousand years
that women were more quick and men more judicious,
women more remarkable for delicacy of expression and
men for stronger powers of concentration. A Parisian
simpleton, who used once upon a time to take his walk
in the gardens of Versailles, similarly concluded from
all he saw that trees grow ready clipped.</p>

<p>I will allow that little girls have less physical strength
than little boys: this must be conclusive as regards
intellect; for everyone knows that Voltaire and d'Alembert
were the first boxers of their age! Everyone agrees,
that a little girl of ten is twenty times as refined as a
little boy of the same age. Why, at twenty, is she a
great idiot, awkward, timid, and afraid of a spider,
while the little boy is a man of intellect?</p>

<p>Women only learn the things we do not wish to teach
them, and only read the lessons taught them by experience
of life. Hence the extreme disadvantage it is for
them to be born in a very rich family; instead of coming
into contact with beings who behave naturally to them,
they find themselves surrounded by maidservants and
governesses, who are already corrupted and blighted by
wealth.<a name="FNanchor_2_203" id="FNanchor_2_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_203" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> There is nothing so foolish as a prince.</p>

<p>Young girls soon see that they are slaves and begin to
look about them very early; they see everything, but
they are too ignorant to see properly. A woman of thirty
in France has not the acquired knowledge of a small boy
of fifteen, a woman of fifty has not the reason of a man
of twenty-five. Look at Madame de Sévigné admiring
Louis XIV's most ridiculous actions. Look at the
puerility of Madame d'Épinay's reasonings.<a name="FNanchor_3_204" id="FNanchor_3_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_204" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>"Women ought to nurse and look after their children."
I deny the first proposition, I allow the second. "They
ought, moreover, to keep their kitchen accounts."&mdash;And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>so have not time to equal a small boy of fifteen in acquired
knowledge! Men must be judges, bankers, barristers,
merchants, doctors, clergymen, etc., and yet they find
time to read Fox's speeches and the <i>Lusiad</i> of Camoëns.</p>

<p>The Pekin magistrate, who hastens at an early hour to
the law courts in order to find the means of imprisoning
and ruining, in perfect good faith, a poor journalist who
has incurred the displeasure of an Under-Secretary of
State, with whom he had the honour of dining the day
before, is surely as busy as his wife, who keeps her
kitchen accounts, gets stockings made for her little
daughter, sees her through her dancing and piano
lessons, receives a visit from the vicar of the parish who
brings her the <i>Quotidienne</i>, and then goes to choose a
hat in the Rue de Richelieu and take a turn in the
Tuileries.</p>

<p>In the midst of his noble occupations this magistrate
still finds time to think of this walk his wife is taking in
the Tuileries, and, if he were in as good odour with the
Power that rules the universe as with that which rules
the State, he would pray Heaven to grant women, for
their own good, eight or ten hours more sleep. In the
present condition of society, leisure, which for man is
the source of all his happiness and all his riches, is for
women so far from being an advantage as to rank among
those baneful liberties, from which the worthy magistrate
would wish to help deliver us.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LV<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_43">(43)</a></span><br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OBJECTIONS TO THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN</span></h3>

<p>"But women are charged with the petty labours
of the household." The Colonel of my regiment,
M. S&mdash;&mdash;, has four daughters, brought up on the
best principles, which means that they work all day.
When I come, they sing the music of Rossini, that I
brought them from Naples. For the rest, they read the
Bible of Royaumont, they learn what's most foolish in
history, that is to say, chronological tables and the verses
of Le Ragois; they know a great deal of geography,
embroider admirably&mdash;and I expect that each of these
pretty little girls could earn, by her work, eight sous a
day. Taking three hundred days, that means four
hundred and eighty francs a year, which is less than is
given to one of their masters. It is for four hundred
and eighty francs a year that they lose for ever the time,
during which it is granted to the human machine to
acquire ideas.</p>

<p>"If women read with pleasure the ten or twelve good
volumes that appear every year in Europe, they will soon
give up the care of their children."&mdash;'Tis as if we feared,
by planting the shore of the ocean with trees, to stop the
motion of the waves. It is not in this sense that education
is all-powerful. Besides, for four hundred years the
same objection has been offered to every sort of education.
And yet a Parisian woman has more good
qualities in 1820 than she ever had in 1720, the age of
Law's system and the Regency, and at that time the daughter
of the richest farmer-general had a less good education
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>than the daughter of the pettiest attorney gets to-day.
Are her household duties less well performed as a result?
Certainly not. And why? Because poverty, illness,
shame, instinct, all force her to fulfil them. It is as if
you said of an officer who is becoming too sociable, that
he will forget how to handle his horse; you have to
remember that he'll break his arm the first time he's
slack in the saddle.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge, where it produces any bad effects at all, does
as much mischief to one sex as to the other</i>. We shall never
lack vanity, even in the completest absence of any reason
for having it&mdash;look at the middle class in a small town.
Why not force it at least to repose on real merit, on merit
useful or agreeable to society?</p>

<p>Demi-fools, carried away by the revolution that is
changing everything in France, began twenty years ago
to allow that women are capable of something. But they
must give themselves up to occupations becoming their
sex: <i>educate flowers, make friendships with birds, and pick
up plants</i>. These are called innocent amusements.</p>

<p>These innocent pleasures are better than idleness.
Well! let's leave them to stupid women; just as we
leave to stupid men the glory of composing verses for
the birthday of the master of the house. But do men
in good faith really mean to suggest to Madame Roland
or to Mistress Hutchinson<a name="FNanchor_1_205" id="FNanchor_1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_205" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that they should spend their
time in tending a little Bengal rose-bush?</p>

<p>All such reasoning can be reduced to this: a man likes
to be able to say of his slave: "She's too big a fool to
be a knave."</p>

<p>But owing to a certain law called <i>sympathy</i>&mdash;a law of
nature which, in truth, vulgar eyes never perceive&mdash;the
defects in the companion of your life are not destructive
of your happiness by reason only of the direct ill they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>can occasion you. I would almost prefer that my wife
should, in a moment of anger, attempt to stab me once
a year, than that she should welcome me every evening
with bad spirits.</p>

<p>Finally, happiness is contagious among people who live
together.</p>

<p>Let your mistress have passed the morning, while you
were on parade or at the House of Commons, in painting
a rose after a masterpiece of Redouté, or in reading a
volume of Shakespeare, her pleasure therein will have
been equally innocent. Only, with the ideas that she
has got from her rose she will soon bore you on your
return, and, indeed, she will crave to go out in the
evening among people to seek sensations a little more
lively. Suppose, on the contrary, she has read Shakespeare,
she is as tired as you are, she has had as much
pleasure, and she will be happier to give you her arm for
a solitary walk in the Bois de Vincennes than to appear
at the smartest party. The pleasures of the fashionable
world are not meant for happy women.</p>

<p>Women have, of course, all ignorant men for enemies to
their instruction. To-day they spend their time with
them, they make love to them and are well received by
them; what would become of them if women began to
get tired of Boston? When we return from America or
the West Indies with a tanned skin and manners that for
six months remain somewhat coarse, how would these
fellows answer our stories, if they had not this phrase:
"As for us, the women are on our side. While you were
at New York the colour of tilburies has changed; it's
grey-black that's fashionable at present." And we listen
attentively, for such knowledge is useful. Such and
such a pretty woman will not look at us if our carriage
is in bad taste.</p>

<p>These same fools, who think themselves obliged, in
virtue of the pre-eminence of their sex, to have more
knowledge than women, would be ruined past all hope, if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>women had the audacity to learn something. A fool
of thirty says to himself, as he looks at some little girls
of twelve at the country house of one of his friends:
"It's in their company that I shall spend my life ten
years from now." We can imagine his exclamations and
his terror, if he saw them studying something useful.</p>

<p>Instead of the society and conversation of effeminate
men, an educated woman, if she has acquired ideas without
losing the graces of her sex, can always be sure of
finding among the most distinguished men of her age a
consideration verging on enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Women would become the rivals instead of the companions
of man." Yes, as soon as you have suppressed
love by edict. While we are waiting for this fine law,
love will redouble its charms and its ecstasy. These are
the plain facts: the basis on which crystallisation rests
will be widened; man will be able to take pleasure in all
his ideas in company of the woman he loves; nature in
all its entirety will in their eyes receive new charms;
and as ideas always reflect some of the refinements of
character, they will understand each other better and
will be guilty of fewer imprudent acts&mdash;love will be less
blind and will produce less unhappiness.</p>

<p>The <i>desire of pleasing secures all that delicacy and
reserve which are of such inestimable value to women</i>
from the influence of any scheme of education. 'Tis as
though you feared teaching the nightingales not to sing
in the spring-time.</p>

<p>The graces of women do not depend on their ignorance;
look at the worthy spouses of our village bourgeois, look
at the wives of the opulent merchants in England.
Affectation is a kind of pedantry; for I call pedantry
the affectation of letting myself talk out of season of a
dress by Leroy or a novel by Romagnesi, just as much as
the affectation of quoting Fra Paolo<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_46" id="TNanch_46"></a><a href="#TN_46">(46)</a></span> and the Council
of Trent <i>à propos</i> of a discussion on our own mild missionaries.
It is the pedantry of dress and good form, it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>is the necessity of saying exactly the conventional phrase
about Rossini, which kills the graces of Parisian women.
Nevertheless, in spite of the terrible effects of this contagious
malady, is it not in Paris that exist the most
delightful women in France? Would not the reason be
that chance filled their heads with the most just and
interesting ideas? Well, it is these very ideas that I
expect from books. I shall not, of course, suggest that
they read Grotius of Puffendorf, now that we have
Tracy's<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_47" id="TNanch_47"></a><a href="#TN_47">(47)</a></span> commentary on Montesquieu.</p>

<p>Woman's delicacy depends on the hazardous position
in which she finds herself so early placed, on the necessity
of spending her life in the midst of cruel and fascinating
enemies.</p>

<p><i>There are, perhaps, fifty thousand females in Great
Britain who are exempted by circumstances from all
necessary labour:</i> but without work there is no happiness.
Passion forces itself to work, and to work of an exceedingly
rough kind&mdash;work that employs the whole activity
of one's being.</p>

<p>A woman with four children and ten thousand francs
income works by making stockings or a frock for her
daughter. But it cannot be allowed that a woman
who has her own carriage is working when she does
her embroidery or a piece of tapestry. Apart from
some faint glow of vanity, she cannot possibly have
any interest in what she is doing. She does not
work.</p>

<p>And thus her happiness runs a grave risk.</p>

<p>And what is more, so does the happiness of her lord
and master, for a woman whose heart for two months
has been enlivened by no other interest than that of
her needlework, may be so insolent as to imagine that
gallant-love, vanity-love, or, in fine, even physical love,
is a very great happiness in comparison with her habitual
condition.</p>

<p>"A woman ought not to make people speak about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>her." To which I answer once more: "Is any woman
specially mentioned as being able to read?"</p>

<p>And what is to prevent women, while awaiting a
revolution in their destiny, from hiding a study which
forms their habitual occupation and furnishes them
every day with an honourable share of happiness. I will
reveal a secret to them by the way. When you have
given yourself a task&mdash;for example, to get a clear idea
about the conspiracy of Fiescho<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_48" id="TNanch_48"></a><a href="#TN_48">(48)</a></span>, at Genoa in 1547&mdash;the
most insipid book becomes interesting. The same is
true, in love, of meeting someone quite indifferent, who
has just seen the person whom you love. This interest
is doubled every month, until you give up the conspiracy
of Fiescho.</p>

<p>"<i>The true theatre for a woman is the sick-chamber.</i>"
But you must be careful to secure that the divine goodness
redoubles the frequency of illnesses, in order to
give occupation to our women. This is arguing from
the exceptional.</p>

<p>Moreover, I maintain that a woman ought to spend
three or four hours of leisure every day, just as men of
sense spend their hours of leisure.</p>

<p>A young mother, whose little son has the measles,
could not, even if she would, find pleasure in reading
Volney's Travels in Syria, any more than her husband, a
rich banker, could get pleasure out of meditating on
Malthus in the midst of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>There is one, and only one, way for rich women to
distinguish themselves from the vulgar: moral superiority.
For in this there is a natural distinction of
feeling.<a name="FNanchor_2_206" id="FNanchor_2_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_206" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"<i>We do not wish a lady to write books.</i>" No,
but does giving your daughter a singing-master engage
you to make her into an opera-singer? If you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>like, I'll say that a woman ought only to write, like
Madame de Staël (de Launay), posthumous works to be
published after her death. For a woman of less than
fifty to publish is to risk her happiness in the most
terrible lottery: if she has the good fortune to have a
lover, she will begin by losing him.</p>

<p>I know but one exception: it is that of a woman who
writes books in order to keep or bring up her family.
In that case she ought always to confine herself to their
money-value when talking of her own works, and say,
for example, to a cavalry major: "Your rank gives you
four thousand francs a year, and I, with my two translations
from the English, was able last year to devote an
extra three thousand five hundred francs to the education
of my two boys."</p>

<p>Otherwise, a woman should publish as Baron d'Holbach
or Madame de la Fayette did; their best friends
knew nothing of it. To print a book can only be without
inconvenience for a courtesan; the vulgar, who can
despise her at their will for her condition, will exalt her
to the heavens for her talent, and even make a cult of it.</p>

<p>Many men in France, among those who have an income
of six thousand francs, find their habitual source of happiness
in literature, without thinking of publishing anything;
to read a good book is for them one of the greatest
pleasures. At the end of ten years they find that their
mind is enlarged twofold, and no one will deny that, in
general, the larger the mind the fewer will be its passions
incompatible with the happiness of others.<a name="FNanchor_3_207" id="FNanchor_3_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_207" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> I don't suppose
anyone will still deny that the sons of a woman who
reads Gibbon and Schiller will have more genius than
the children of one who tells her beads and reads Madame
de Genlis.</p>

<p>A young barrister, a merchant, an engineer can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>launched on life without any education; they pick it
up themselves every day by practising their profession.
But what resources have their wives for acquiring
estimable or necessary qualities? Hidden in the solitude
of their household, for them the great book of life
necessarily remains shut. They spend always in the same
way, after discussing the accounts with their cook, the
three <i>louis</i> they get every Monday from their husbands.</p>

<p>I say this in the interest of the tyrant: the least of
men, if he is twenty and has nice rosy cheeks, is a danger
to a woman with no knowledge, because she is wholly
a creature of instinct. In the eyes of a woman of intellect
he will produce as much effect as a handsome
lackey.</p>

<p>The amusing thing in present-day education is that
you teach young girls nothing that they won't have to
forget as soon as they are married. It needs four hours
a day, for six years, to learn to play the harp well; to
paint well in miniature or water-colours needs half that
time. Most young girls do not attain even to a tolerable
mediocrity&mdash;hence the very true saying: "Amateur
means smatterer."<a name="FNanchor_4_208" id="FNanchor_4_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_208" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>And even supposing a young girl has some talent;
three years after she is married she won't take up her
harp or her brushes once a month. These objects of so
much study now only bore her&mdash;unless chance has given
her the soul of an artist, and this is always a rarity and
scarcely helpful in the management of a household.</p>

<p>And thus under the vain pretext of decency you
teach young girls nothing that can give them guidance in
the circumstances they will encounter in their lives.
You do more&mdash;you hide and deny these circumstances
in order to add to their strength, through the effect
(i) of surprise, and (ii) of mistrust; for education, once
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>found deceitful, must bring mistrust on education as a
whole.<a name="FNanchor_5_209" id="FNanchor_5_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_209" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I maintain that one ought to talk of love to
girls who have been well brought up. Who will dare
suggest in good faith that, in the actual state of our
manners, girls of sixteen do not know of the existence of
love? From whom do they get this idea so important
and so difficult to give properly? Think of Julie
d'Étanges deploring the knowledge that she owes to la
Chaillot, one of the maidservants. One must thank
Rousseau for having dared be a true painter in an age of
false decency.</p>

<p>The present-day education of women being perhaps
the most delightful absurdity in modern Europe, strictly
speaking the less education they have, the better they
are.<a name="FNanchor_6_210" id="FNanchor_6_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_210" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> It is for this reason perhaps that in Italy and
Spain they are so superior to the men, and I will even
say so superior to the women of other countries.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVI<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_43">(43)</a></span><br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OBJECTIONS TO THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN<br />

(<i>continued</i>)</span></h3>


<p>In France all our ideas about women are got from a
twopence-halfpenny catechism. The delightful part of
it is that many people, who would not allow the authority
of this book to regulate a matter of fifty francs, foolishly
follow it word for word in that which bears most nearly
on their happiness. Such is the vanity of nineteenth-century
ways!</p>

<p>There must be no divorce because marriage is a mystery&mdash;and
what mystery? The emblem of the union of
Jesus Christ with the Church. And what had become of
this mystery, if the Church had been given a name of
the masculine gender?<a name="FNanchor_1_211" id="FNanchor_1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_211" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But let us pass over prejudices
already giving way,<a name="FNanchor_2_212" id="FNanchor_2_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_212" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and let us merely observe this singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>spectacle: the root of the tree sapped by the axe
of ridicule, but the branches continuing to flower.</p>

<p>Now to return to the observation of facts and their
consequences.</p>

<p>In both sexes it is on the manner in which youth has
been employed that depends the fate of extreme old
age&mdash;this is true for women earlier than for men. How
is a woman of forty-five received in society? Severely,
or more often in a way that is below her dignity. Women
are flattered at twenty and abandoned at forty.</p>

<p>A woman of forty-five is of importance only by reason
of her children or her lover.</p>

<p>A mother who excels in the fine arts can communicate
her talent to her son only in the extremely rare case,
where he has received from nature precisely the soul for
this talent. But a mother of intellect and culture will
give her young son a grasp not only of all merely agreeable
talents, but also of all talents that are useful to
man in society; and he will be able to make his own
choice. The barbarism of the Turks depends in great
part on the state of moral degradation among the
beautiful Georgians. Two young men born at Paris
owe to their mothers the incontestable superiority that
they show at sixteen over the young provincials of their
age. It is from sixteen to twenty-five that the luck
turns.</p>

<p>The men who invented gunpowder, printing, the art
of weaving, contribute every day to our happiness, and
the same is true of the Montesquieus, the Racines and the
La Fontaines. Now the number of geniuses produced
by a nation is in proportion to the number of men
receiving sufficient culture,<a name="FNanchor_3_213" id="FNanchor_3_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_213" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and there is nothing to prove
to me that my bootmaker has not the soul to write like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>Corneille. He wants the education necessary to develop
his feelings and teach him to communicate them to the
public.<a name="FNanchor_4_214" id="FNanchor_4_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_214" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Owing to the present system of girls' education, all
geniuses who are born women are lost to the public good.
So soon as chance gives them the means of displaying
themselves, you see them attain to talents the most difficult
to acquire. In our own days you see a Catherine II,
who had no other education but danger and ...;
a Madame Roland; an Alessandra Mari, who raised a
regiment in Arezzo and sent it against the French; a
Caroline, Queen of Naples, who knew how to put a stop
to the contagion of liberalism better than all our Castlereaghs
and our Pitts. As for what stands in the way of
women's superiority in works of art, see the <a href="#Page_81">chapter on
Modesty</a>, article 9. What might Miss Edgeworth not
have done, if the circumspection necessary to a young
English girl had not forced her at the outset of her
career to carry the pulpit into her novel?</p>

<p>What man is there, in love or in marriage, who has the
good fortune to be able to communicate his thoughts,
just as they occur to him, to the woman with whom he
passes his life? He may find a good heart that will share
his sorrows, but he is always obliged to turn his thoughts
into small change if he wishes to be understood, and it
would be ridiculous to expect reasonable counsel from
an intellect that has need of such a method in order to
seize the facts. The most perfect woman, according
to the ideas of present-day education, leaves her partner
isolated amid the dangers of life and soon runs the risk of
wearying him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>What an excellent counsellor would a man not find in
a wife, if only she could think&mdash;a counsellor, after all,
whose interests, apart from one single object, and one
which does not last beyond the morning of life, are
exactly identical with his own!</p>

<p>One of the finest prerogatives of the mind is that it
provides old age with consideration. See how the arrival
of Voltaire in Paris makes the Royal majesty pale. But
poor women! so soon as they have no longer the brilliance
of youth, their one sad happiness is to be able to
delude themselves on the part they take in society.</p>

<p>The ruins of youthful talents become merely ridiculous,
and it were a happiness for our women, such as they
actually are, to die at fifty. As for a higher morality&mdash;the
clearer the mind, the surer the conviction that justice
is the only road to happiness. Genius is a power; but
still more is it a torch, to light the way to the great
art of being happy.</p>

<p>Most men have a moment in their life when they are
capable of great things&mdash;that moment when nothing
seems impossible to them. The ignorance of women
causes this magnificent chance to be lost to the human
race. Love, nowadays, at the very most will make a
man a good horseman or teach him to choose his tailor.</p>

<p>I have no time to defend myself against the advances
of criticism. If my word could set up systems, I should
give girls, as far as possible, exactly the same education
as boys. As I have no intention of writing a book about
everything and nothing, I shall be excused from explaining
in what regards the present education of men is
absurd. But taking it such as it is (they are not taught
the two premier sciences, logic and ethics), it is better,
I say, to give this education to girls than merely to teach
them to play the piano, to paint in water-colours and to
do needlework.</p>

<p>Teach girls, therefore, reading, writing and arithmetic
by the monitorial<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_44">(44)</a></span> system in the central convent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>schools, in which the presence of any man, except the
masters, should be severely punished. The great advantage
of bringing children together is that, however
narrow the masters may be, in spite of them the children
learn from their little comrades the art of living in the
world and of managing conflicting interests. A sensible
master would explain their little quarrels and friendships
to the children, and begin his course of ethics in this
way rather than with the story of the Golden Calf.<a name="FNanchor_5_215" id="FNanchor_5_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_215" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>No doubt some years hence the monitorial system will
be applied to everything that is learnt; but, taking
things as they actually are, I would have girls learn Latin
like boys. Latin is a good subject because it accustoms
one to be bored; with Latin should go history, mathematics,
a knowledge of the plants useful as nourishment
or medicine; then logic and the moral sciences, etc.
Dancing, music and drawing ought to begin at five.</p>

<p>At sixteen a girl ought to think about finding a husband,
and get from her mother right ideas on love, marriage,
and the want of honesty that exists among men.<a name="FNanchor_6_216" id="FNanchor_6_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_216" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">(Part II)<br />

ON MARRIAGE</span></h3>


<p>The fidelity of married women, where love is absent,
is probably something contrary to nature.<a name="FNanchor_1_217" id="FNanchor_1_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_217" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Men have attempted to obtain this unnatural result
by the fear of hell and sentiments of religion; the example
of Spain and Italy shows how far they have
succeeded.</p>

<p>In France they have attempted to obtain it by public
opinion&mdash;the one dyke capable of resistance, yet it has
been badly built. It is absurd to tell a young girl: "You
must be faithful to the husband of your choice," and
then to marry her by force to a boring old dotard.<a name="FNanchor_2_218" id="FNanchor_2_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_218" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>"But girls are pleased to get married." Because,
under the narrow system of present-day education, the
slavery that they undergo in their mother's house is
intolerably tedious; further, they lack enlightenment;
and, lastly, there are the demands of nature. There is
but one way to obtain more fidelity among married
women: it is to give freedom to girls and divorce to
married people.</p>

<p>A woman always loses the fairest days of her youth in
her first marriage, and by divorce she gives fools the
chance of talking against her.</p>

<p>Young women who have plenty of lovers have nothing
to get from divorce, and women of a certain age, who
have already had them, hope to repair their reputation&mdash;in
France they always succeed in doing so&mdash;by showing
themselves extremely severe against the errors which
have left them behind. It is generally some wretched
young woman, virtuous and desperately in love, who
seeks a divorce, and gets her good name blackened at
the hands of women who have had fifty different men.</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_217" id="Footnote_1_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_217"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Not probably&mdash;but certainly. With love there, one has no taste
for any water but that of the beloved fount. So far fidelity is natural.
</p>
<p>
In the case of marriage without love, in less than two years the water of
this fountain becomes bitter. Now the desire for water always exists in
nature. Habits may conquer nature, but only when it can be conquered in
an instant: the Indian wife who burns herself (October 21st, 1821), after
the death of the old husband whom she hated; the European girl who
barbarously murders the innocent child to whom she has just given life.
But for a very high wall the monks would soon leave the monastery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_218" id="Footnote_2_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_218"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Even down to details, with us everything that regards the education
of women is comic. For example, in 1820, under the rule of these very
nobles who have proscribed divorce, the Home Office sends to the town
of Lâon a bust and a statue of Gabrielle d'Estrées. The statue is to be
set up in the public square, apparently to spread love of the Bourbons
among the young girls and to exhort them, in case of need, not to be
cruel to amorous kings and to give scions to this illustrious family.
</p>
<p>
But, in return, the same office refuses the town of Lâon a bust of
Marshal Serrurier, a brave man who was no gallant, and moreover had
been so vulgar as to begin his career by the trade of private soldier. (Speech
of General Foy, <i>Courrier</i> of 17th June, 1820. Dulaure, in his curious
<i>History of Paris</i>, Amours of Henry IV.)</p></div>

<span style="font-size: smaller;">OF VIRTUE, SO CALLED</span></h3>


<p>Myself, I honour with the name of virtue the
habit of doing painful actions which are of use
to others.</p>

<p>St. Simon Stylites, who sits twenty-two years on the
top of a column beating himself with a strap, is in my
eyes, I confess, not at all virtuous; and it is this that
gives this essay a tone only too unprincipled.</p>

<p>I esteem not a bit more the Chartreux monk who eats
nothing but fish and allows himself to talk only on
Thursday. I own I prefer General Carnot, who, at an
advanced age, puts up with the rigours of exile in a little
northern town rather than do a base action.</p>

<p>I have some hope that this extremely vulgar declaration
will lead the reader to skip the rest of this chapter.</p>

<p>This morning, a holiday, at Pesaro (May 7th, 1819),
being obliged to go to Mass, I got hold of a Missal and
fell upon these words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Joanna, Alphonsi quinti Lusitaniae regis filia, tanta divini
amoris flamma praeventa fuit, ut ab ipsa pueritia rerum caducarum
pertaesa, solo coelestis patriae desiderio flagraret.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The virtue so touchingly preached by the very beautiful
words of the <i>Génie du Christianisme</i><span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_50" id="TNanch_50"></a><a href="#TN_50">(50)</a></span> is thus
reduced to not eating truffles for fear of a stomach-ache.
It is quite a reasonable calculation, if you believe in hell;
but it is a self-interested calculation, the most personal
and prosaic possible. That philosophic virtue, which so
well explains the return of Regulus to Carthage, and
which was responsible for some similar incidents in our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>own Revolution,<a name="FNanchor_1_219" id="FNanchor_1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_219" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> proves, on the contrary, generosity of
soul.</p>

<p>It is merely in order not to be burned in the next
world, in a great caldron of boiling oil, that Madame
de Tourvel resists Valmont. I cannot imagine how the
idea, with all its ignominy, of being the rival of a caldron
of boiling oil does not drive Valmont away.</p>

<p>How much more touching is Julie d'Étanges, respecting
her vows and the happiness of M. de Wolmar.</p>

<p>What I say of Madame de Tourvel, I find applicable
to the lofty virtue of Mistress Hutchinson. What a soul
did Puritanism steal away from love!</p>

<p>One of the oddest peculiarities of this world is that
men always think they know whatever it is clearly
necessary for them to know. Hear them talk about
politics, that very complicated science; hear them talk of
marriage and morals.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LVIII<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">STATE OF EUROPE WITH REGARD TO MARRIAGE</span></h3>


<p>So far we have only treated the question of marriage
according to theory;<a name="FNanchor_1_220" id="FNanchor_1_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_220" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> we are now to treat it according
to the facts.</p>

<p>Which of all countries is that in which there are the
most happy marriages? Without dispute, Protestant
Germany<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_52" id="TNanch_52"></a><a href="#TN_52">(52)</a></span>.</p>

<p>I extract the following fragment from the diary of
Captain Salviati, without changing a single word in it:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Halberstadt, <i>June 23rd</i>, 1807.... Nevertheless,
M. de Bülow is absolutely and openly in love with Mademoiselle
de Feltheim; he follows her about everywhere,
always, talks to her unceasingly, and very often keeps her
yards away from us. Such open marks of affection shock
society, break it up&mdash;and on the banks of the Seine would
pass for the height of indecency. The Germans think
much less than we do about what breaks up society;
indecency is little more than a conventional evil. For five
years M. de Bülow has been paying court in this way to
Mina, whom he has been unable to marry owing to the
war. All the young ladies in society have their lover,
and he is known to everyone. Among all the German
acquaintances of my friend M. de Mermann<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_53" id="TNanch_53"></a><a href="#TN_53">(53)</a></span> there
is not a single one who has not married for love.</p>

<p>"Mermann, his brother George, M. de Voigt, M. de
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>Lazing, etc. He has just given me the names of a dozen
of them.</p>

<p>"The open and passionate way in which these lovers
pay their court to their mistresses would be the height
of indecency, absurdity and shame in France.</p>

<p>"Mermann told me this evening, as we were returning
from the <i>Chasseur Vert</i>, that, among all the women of
his very numerous family, he did not suppose there was a
single one who had deceived her husband. Allowing
that he is wrong about half of them, it is still a singular
country.</p>

<p>"His shady proposal to his sister-in-law, Madame de
Munichow, whose family is about to die out for want of
male heirs and its very considerable possessions revert to
the crown, coldly received, but merely with: 'Let's hear
no more of that.'</p>

<p>"He tells the divine Philippine (who has just obtained
a divorce from her husband, who only wanted to sell her
to his Sovereign) something about it in very covert terms.
Unfeigned indignation, toned down in its expression
instead of being exaggerated: 'Have you, then, no longer
any respect for our sex? I prefer to think, for the sake
of your honour, that you're joking.'</p>

<p>"During a journey to the Brocken with this really
beautiful woman, she reclined on his shoulder while
asleep or pretending to sleep; a jolt threw her somewhat
on to the top of him, and he put his arm round her waist;
she threw herself into the other corner of the carriage.
He doesn't think that she is incorruptible, but he believes
that she would kill herself the day after her mistake.
What is certain is that he loved her passionately and that
he was similarly loved by her, that they saw each other
continually and that she is without reproach. But the
sun is very pale at Halberstadt, the Government very
meddling, and these two persons very cold. In their
most passionate interviews Kant and Klopstock were
always of the party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>"Mermann told me that a married man, convicted of
adultery, could be condemned by the courts of Brunswick
to ten years' imprisonment; the law has fallen into
disuse, but at least ensures that people do not joke about
this sort of affair. The distinction of being a man with
a past is very far from being such an advantage here as it
is in France, where you can scarcely refuse it a married
man in his presence without insulting him.</p>

<p>"Anyone who told my Colonel or Ch... that they
no longer have women since their marriage would get a
very poor reception.</p>

<p>"Some years ago a woman of this country, in a fit of
religious fervour, told her husband, a gentleman of the
Court of Brunswick, that she had deceived him for six
years together. The husband, as big a fool as his wife,
went to tell the news to the Duke; the gallant was
obliged to resign all his employments and to leave the
country in twenty-four hours, under a threat from the
Duke to put the laws in motion. "</p>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Halberstadt</span>, <i>July 7th</i>, 1807.</p>

<p>"Husbands are not deceived here, 'tis true&mdash;but ye
gods, what women! Statues, masses scarcely organic!
Before marriage they are exceedingly attractive, graceful
as gazelles, with quick tender eyes that always understand
the least hint of love. The reason is that they are
on the look out for a husband. So soon as the husband is
found, they become absolutely nothing but getters of
children, in a state of perpetual adoration before the
begetter. In a family of four or five children there
must always be one of them ill, since half the children
die before seven, and in this country, immediately one
of the babies is ill, the mother goes out no more. I can
see that they find an indescribable pleasure in being
caressed by their children. Little by little they lose all
their ideas. It is the same at Philadelphia. There girls
of the wildest and most innocent gaiety become, in less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>than a year, the most boring of women. To have done
with the marriages of Protestant Germany&mdash;a wife's
dowry is almost nil because of the fiefs. Mademoiselle
de Diesdorff, daughter of a man with an income of
forty thousand francs, will have a dowry of perhaps
two thousand crowns (seven thousand five hundred
francs).</p>

<p>"M. de Mermann got four thousand crowns with his
wife.</p>

<p>"The rest of the dowry is payable in vanity at the
Court. 'One could find among the middle class,' Mermann
told me, 'matches with a hundred or a hundred
and fifty thousand crowns (six hundred thousand francs
instead of fifteen). But one could no longer be presented
at Court; one would be barred all society in which a
prince or princess appeared: <i>it's terrible.</i>' These were
his words, and they came from the heart.</p>

<p>"A German woman with the soul of Phi..., her
intellect, her noble and sensitive face, the fire she must
have had at eighteen (she is now twenty-seven), a woman
such as this country produces, with her virtue, naturalness
and no more than a useful little dose of religion&mdash;such a
woman would no doubt make her husband very happy.
But how flatter oneself that one would remain true to
such insipid matrons?</p>

<p>"'But he was married,' she answered me this morning
when I blamed the four years'silence of Corinne's lover,
Lord Oswald. She sat up till three o'clock to read <i>Corinne</i>.
The novel gave her profound emotion, and now she
answers me with touching candour: 'But he was married.'</p>

<p>"Phi... is so natural, with so naive a sensibility,
that even in this land of the natural, she seems a prude
to the petty heads that govern petty hearts; their
witticisms make her sick, and she in no way hides it.</p>

<p>"When she is in good company, she laughs like mad
at the most lively jokes. It was she who told me the story
of the young princess of sixteen, later on so well known.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>who often managed to make the officer on guard at her
door come up into her rooms. "</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Switzerland</span></p>

<p>I know few families happier than those of the Oberland,
the part of Switzerland that lies round Berne; and
it is a fact of public notoriety (1816) that the girls there
spend Saturday to Sunday nights with their lovers.</p>

<p>The fools who know the world, after a voyage from
Paris to Saint Cloud, will cry out; happily I find in a
Swiss writer confirmation of what I myself<a name="FNanchor_2_221" id="FNanchor_2_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_221" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> saw during
four months.</p>

<p>"An honest peasant complained of certain losses he
had sustained in his orchard; I asked him why he didn't
keep a dog: 'My daughters would never get married.'
I did not understand his answer; he told me he had
had such a bad-tempered dog that none of the young
men dared climb up to the windows any longer.</p>

<p>"Another peasant, mayor of his village, told me in
praise of his wife, that when she was a girl no one had
had more <i>Kilter</i> or <i>Wächterer</i>&mdash;that is, had had more
young men come to spend the night with her.</p>

<p>"A Colonel, widely esteemed, was forced, while crossing
the mountains, to spend the night at the bottom of one
of the most lonely and picturesque valleys in the country.
He lodged with the first magistrate in the valley, a man
rich and of good repute. On entering, the stranger
noticed a young girl of sixteen, a model of gracefulness,
freshness and simplicity: she was the daughter of the
master of the house. That night there was a village
ball; the stranger paid court to the girl, who was really
strikingly beautiful. At last, screwing up courage, he
ventured to ask her whether he couldn't 'keep watch' with
her. 'No,' answered the girl, 'I share a room with my
cousin, but I'll come myself to yours.' You can judge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>of the confusion this answer gave him. They had supper,
the stranger got up, the girl took a torch and followed
him into his room; he imagined the moment was at
hand. 'Oh no,' she said simply, 'I must first ask Mamma's
permission.' He would have been less staggered by a
thunderbolt! She went out; his courage revived; he
slipped into these good folks' parlour, and listened to
the girl begging her mother in a caressing tone to grant
her the desired permission; in the end she got it. 'Eh,
old man,' said the mother to her husband who was already
in bed, 'd'you allow Trineli to spend the night with
the Colonel?' 'With all my heart,' answers the father,
'I think I'd lend even my wife to such a man.' 'Right
then, go,' says the mother to Trineli; 'but be a good
girl, and don't take off your petticoat...' At day-break,
Trineli, respected by the stranger, rose still virgin.
She arranged the bedclothes, prepared coffee and cream
for her partner and, after she had breakfasted with him,
seated on his bed, cut off a little piece of her <i>broustpletz</i>
(a piece of velvet going over the breast). 'Here,' she
said, 'keep this souvenir of a happy night; I shall never
forget it.&mdash;Why are you a Colonel?' And giving him
a last kiss, she ran away; he didn't manage to see her
again.<a name="FNanchor_3_222" id="FNanchor_3_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_222" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Here you have the absolute opposite of French
morals, and I am far from approving them."</p>

<p>Were I a legislator, I would have people adopt in
France, as in Germany, the custom of evening dances.
Three times a week girls would go with their mothers to
a ball, beginning at seven and ending at midnight, and
demanding no other outlay but a violin and a few glasses
of water. In a neighbouring room the mothers, maybe
a little jealous of their daughters' happy education,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>would play boston; in a third, the fathers would find
papers and could talk politics. Between midnight and
one o'clock all the families would collect together and
return to the paternal roof. Girls would get to know
young men; they would soon come to loathe fatuity
and the indiscretions it is responsible for&mdash;in fact they
would choose themselves husbands. Some girls would
have unhappy love-affairs, but the number of deceived
husbands and unhappy matches would diminish to an
immense degree. It would then be less absurd to attempt
to punish infidelity with dishonour. The law could say
to young women: "You have chosen your husband&mdash;be
faithful to him." In those circumstances I would
allow the indictment and punishment by the courts of
what the English call criminal conversation. The courts
could impose, to the profit of prisons and hospitals, a
fine equal to two-thirds of the seducer's fortune and
imprisonment for several years.</p>

<p>A woman could be indicted for adultery before a
jury. The jury should first declare that the husband's
conduct had been irreproachable.</p>

<p>A woman, if convicted, could be condemned to imprisonment
for life. If the husband had been absent
more than two years, the woman could not be condemned
to more than some years' imprisonment. Public morals
would soon model themselves on these laws and would
perfect them.<a name="FNanchor_4_223" id="FNanchor_4_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_223" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>And then the nobles and the priests, still regretting
bitterly the proper times of Madame de Montespan or
Madame du Barry, would be forced to allow divorce.<a name="FNanchor_5_224" id="FNanchor_5_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_224" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>There would be in a village within sight of Paris an
asylum for unfortunate women, a house of refuge into
which, under pain of the galleys, no man besides the
doctor and the almoner should enter. A woman who
wished to get a divorce would be bound, first of all, to
go and place herself as prisoner in this asylum; there she
would spend two years without going out once. She
could write, but never receive an answer.</p>

<p>A council composed of peers of France and certain
magistrates of repute would direct, in the woman's name,
the proceedings for a divorce and would regulate the
pension to be paid to the institution by the husband.
A woman who failed in her plea before the courts would
be allowed to spend the rest of her life in the asylum.
The Government would compensate the administration
of the asylum with a sum of two thousand francs for
each woman who sought its refuge. To be received in
the asylum, a woman must have had a dowry of over
twenty thousand francs. The moral <i>régime</i> would be
one of extreme severity.</p>

<p>After two years of complete seclusion from the world,
a divorced woman could marry again.</p>

<p>Once arrived at this point, Parliament could consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>whether, in order to infuse in girls a spirit of emulation,
it would not be advisable to allow the sons a share of
the paternal heritage double that of their sisters. The
daughters who did not find husbands would have a
share equal to that of the male children. It may be
remarked, by the way, that this system would, little by
little, destroy the only too inconvenient custom of
marriages of convenience. The possibility of divorce
would render useless such outrageous meanness.</p>

<p>At various points in France, and in certain poor villages,
thirty abbeys for old maids should be established. The
Government should endeavour to surround these establishments
with consideration, in order to console a little
the sorrows of the poor women who were to end their
lives there. They should be given all the toys of dignity.</p>

<p>But enough of such chimeras!</p>

laugh and said: 'Villarceaux, we are too old, you and I, to attack young
ladies of fifteen.' And like a gallant man, he laughed at him and told the

<h3>CHAPTER LIX<br />

<span style="font-size: smaller;">WERTHER AND DON JUAN</span></h3>


<p>Among young people, when they have done with
mocking at some poor lover, and he has left the
room, the conversation generally ends by discussing the
question, whether it is better to deal with women like
Mozart's Don Juan or like Werther. The contrast would
be more exact, if I had said Saint-Preux, but he is so
dull a personage, that in making him their representative,
I should be wronging feeling hearts.</p>

<p>Don Juan's character requires the greater number of
useful and generally esteemed virtues&mdash;admirable daring,
resourcefulness, vivacity, a cool head, a witty mind, etc.</p>

<p>The Don Juans have great moments of bitterness and
a very miserable old age&mdash;but then most men do not
reach old age.</p>

<p>The lover plays a poor rôle in the drawing-room in the
evening, because to be a success and a power among
women a man must show just as much keenness on winning
them as on a game of billiards. As everybody
knows that the lover has a great interest in life, he exposes
himself, for all his cleverness, to mockery. Only, next
morning he wakes, not to be in a bad temper until
something piquant or something nasty turns up to revive
him, but to dream of her he loves and build castles in
the air for love to dwell in.</p>

<p>Love <i>à la</i> Werther opens the soul to all the arts, to
all sweet and romantic impressions, to the moonlight, to
the beauty of the forest, to the beauty of pictures&mdash;in a
word, to the feeling and enjoyment of the beautiful,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>under whatever form it be found, even under the coarsest
cloak. It causes man to find happiness even without
riches.<a name="FNanchor_1_225" id="FNanchor_1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_225" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Such souls, instead of growing weary like
Mielhan, Bezenval, etc., go mad, like Rousseau, from an
excess of sensibility. Women endowed with a certain
elevation of soul, who, after their first youth, know how
to recognise love, both where it is and what it is, generally
escape the Don Juan&mdash;he is remarkable in their eyes
rather by the number than the quality of his conquests.
Observe, to the prejudice of tender hearts, that publicity
is as necessary to Don Juan's triumph as secrecy is to
Werther's. Most of the men who make women the
business of their life are born in the lap of luxury;
that is to say, they are, as a result of their education and
the example set by everything that surrounded them in
youth, hardened egoists.<a name="FNanchor_2_226" id="FNanchor_2_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_226" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The real Don Juan even ends by looking on women as
the enemy, and rejoicing in their misfortunes of every
sort.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the charming Duke delle Pignatelle
showed us the proper way to find happiness in pleasures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>even without passion. "I know that I like a woman,"
he told me one evening, "when I find myself completely
confused in her company, and don't know what to say to
her." So far from letting his self-esteem be put to
shame or take its revenge for these embarrassing
moments, he cultivated them lovingly as the source of his
happiness. With this charming young man gallant-love
was quite free from the corroding influence of
vanity; his was a shade of true love, pale, but innocent
and unmixed; and he respected all women, as charming
beings, towards whom we are far from just. (February
20, 1820.)</p>

<p>As a man does not choose himself a temperament, that
is to say, a soul, he cannot play a part above him. J. J.
Rousseau and the Duc de Richelieu might have tried in
vain; for all their cleverness, they could never have
exchanged their fortunes with respect to women. I
could well believe that the Duke never had moments
such as those that Rousseau experienced in the park de la
Chevrette with Madame d'Houdetot; at Venice, when
listening to the music of the <i>Scuole</i>; and at Turin at
the feet of Madame Bazile. But then he never had to
blush at the ridicule that overwhelmed Rousseau in his
affair with Madame de Larnage, remorse for which
pursued him during the rest of his life.</p>

<p>A Saint-Preux's part is sweeter and fills up every
moment of existence, but it must be owned that that
of a Don Juan is far more brilliant. Saint-Preux's tastes
may change at middle age: solitary and retired, and of
pensive habits, he takes a back place on the stage of life,
while Don Juan realises the magnificence of his reputation
among men, and could yet perhaps please a woman
of feeling by making sincerely the sacrifice of his libertine's
tastes.</p>

<p>After all the reasons offered so far, on both sides of
the question, the balance still seems to be even. What
makes me think that the Werthers are the happier, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>that Don Juan reduces love to the level of an ordinary
affair. Instead of being able, like Werther, to shape
realities to his desires, he finds, in love, desires which are
imperfectly satisfied by cold reality, just as in ambition,
avarice or other passions. Instead of losing himself in
the enchanting reveries of crystallisation, he thinks, like
a general, of the success of his manoeuvres<a name="FNanchor_3_227" id="FNanchor_3_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_227" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and, in a
word, he kills love, instead of enjoying it more keenly
than other men, as ordinary people imagine.</p>

<p>This seems to me unanswerable. And there is another
reason, which is no less so in my eyes, though, thanks to
the malignity of Providence, we must pardon men for
not recognising it. The habit of justice is, to my thinking,
apart from accidents, the most assured way of arriving
at happiness&mdash;and a Werther is no villain.<a name="FNanchor_4_228" id="FNanchor_4_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_228" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>To be happy in crime, it is absolutely necessary to have
no remorse. I do not know whether such a creature can
exist;<a name="FNanchor_5_229" id="FNanchor_5_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_229" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> I have never seen him. I would bet that the
affair of Madame Michelin disturbed the Duc de Richelieu's
nights.</p>

<p>One ought either to have absolutely no sympathy or
be able to put the human race to death&mdash;which is impossible.<a name="FNanchor_6_230" id="FNanchor_6_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_230" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>People who only know love from novels will experience
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>a natural repugnance in reading these words in
favour of virtue in love. The reason is that, by the laws
of the novel, the portraiture of a virtuous love is essentially
tiresome and uninteresting. Thus the sentiment of
virtue seems from a distance to neutralise that of love,
and the words "a virtuous love" seem synonymous with
a feeble love. But all this comes from weakness in the
art of painting, and has nothing to do with passion such
as it exists in nature.<a name="FNanchor_7_231" id="FNanchor_7_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_231" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>I beg to be allowed to draw a picture of my most
intimate friend.</p>

<p>Don Juan renounces all the duties which bind him to
the rest of men. In the great market of life he is a
dishonest merchant, who is always buying and never
paying. The idea of equality inspires the same rage in
him as water in a man with hydrophobia; it is for this
reason that pride of birth goes so well with the character
of Don Juan. With the idea of the equality of rights
disappears that of justice, or, rather, if Don Juan is
sprung from an illustrious family, such common ideas
have never come to him. I could easily believe that a
man with an historic name is sooner disposed than
another to set fire to the town in order to get his egg
cooked.<a name="FNanchor_8_232" id="FNanchor_8_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_232" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> We must excuse him; he is so possessed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>self-love that he comes to the point of losing all idea of
the evil he causes, and of seeing no longer anything in
the universe capable of joy or sorrow except himself.
In the fire of youth, when passion fills our own hearts
with the pulse of life and keeps us from mistrust of
others, Don Juan, all senses and apparent happiness,
applauds himself for thinking only of himself, while he
sees other men pay their sacrifices to duty. He imagines
that he has found out the great art of living. But, in
the midst of his triumph, while still scarcely thirty years
of age, he perceives to his astonishment that life is
wanting, and feels a growing disgust for what were all
his pleasures. Don Juan told me at Thorn, in an access
of melancholy: "There are not twenty different sorts
of women, and once you have had two or three of each
sort, satiety sets in." I answered: "It is only imagination
that can for ever escape satiety. Each woman inspires
a different interest, and, what is more, if chance
throws the same woman in your way two or three years
earlier or later in the course of life, and if chance means
you to love, you can love the same woman in different
manners. But a woman of gentle heart, even when she
loved you, would produce in you, because of her pretensions
to equality, only irritation to your pride. Your
way of having women kills all the other pleasures of life;
Werther's increases them a hundredfold."</p>

<p>This sad tragedy reaches the last act. You see Don
Juan in old age, turning on this and that, never on himself,
as the cause of his own satiety. You see him, tormented
by a consuming poison, flying from this to that
in a continual change of purpose. But, however brilliant
the appearances may be, in the end he only changes one
misery for another. He tries the boredom of inaction,
he tries the boredom of excitement&mdash;there is nothing
else for him to choose.</p>

<p>At last he discovers the fatal truth and confesses it to
himself; henceforward he is reduced for all his enjoyment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>to making display of his power, and openly doing
evil for evil's sake. In short, 'tis the last degree of
settled gloom; no poet has dared give us a faithful
picture of it&mdash;the picture, if true, would strike horror.
But one may hope that a man, above the ordinary, will
retrace his steps along this fatal path; for at the bottom
of Don Juan's character there is a contradiction. I have
supposed him a man of great intellect, and great intellect
leads us to the discovery of virtue by the road that runs
to the temple of glory.<a name="FNanchor_9_233" id="FNanchor_9_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_233" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>La Rochefoucauld, who, however, was a master of
self-love, and who in real life was nothing but a silly
man of letters,<a name="FNanchor_10_234" id="FNanchor_10_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_234" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> says(267): "The pleasure of love consists
in loving, and a man gets more happiness from the
passion he feels than from the passion he inspires."</p>

<p>Don Juan's happiness consists in vanity, based, it is
true, on circumstances brought about by great intelligence
and activity; but he must feel that the most
inconsiderable general who wins a battle, the most inconsiderable
prefect who keeps his department in order,
realises a more signal enjoyment than his own. The Duc
de Nemours' happiness when Madame de Clèves tells
him that she loves him, is, I imagine, above Napoleon's
happiness at Marengo.</p>

<p>Love <i>à la</i> Don Juan is a sentiment of the same kind as
a taste for hunting. It is a desire for activity which must
be kept alive by divers objects and by putting a man's
talents continually to the test.</p>

<p>Love <i>à la</i> Werther is like the feeling of a schoolboy
writing a tragedy&mdash;and a thousand times better; it is
a new goal, to which everything in life is referred and
which changes the face of everything. Passion-love casts
all nature in its sublimer aspects before the eyes of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>man, as a novelty invented but yesterday. He is amazed
that he has never seen the singular spectacle that is now
discovered to his soul. Everything is new, everything is
alive, everything breathes the most passionate interest.<a name="FNanchor_11_235" id="FNanchor_11_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_235" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
A lover sees the woman he loves on the horizon of every
landscape he comes across, and, while he travels a hundred
miles to go and catch a glimpse of her for an instant,
each tree, each rock speaks to him of her in a different
manner and tells him something new about her. Instead
of the tumult of this magic spectacle, Don Juan
finds that external objects have for him no value apart
from their degree of utility, and must be made amusing
by some new intrigue.</p>

<p>Love <i>à la</i> Werther has strange pleasures; after a year
or two, the lover has now, so to speak, but one heart
with her he loves; and this, strange to say, even independent
of his success in love&mdash;even under a cruel
mistress. Whatever he does, whatever he sees, he asks
himself: "What would she say if she were with me?
What would I say to her about this view of Casa-Lecchio?"
He speaks to her, he hears her answer, he
smiles at her fun. A hundred miles from her, and under
the weight of her anger, he surprises himself, reflecting:
"Léonore was very gay that night." Then he wakes up:
"Good God!" he says to himself with a sigh, "there
are madmen in Bedlam less mad than I."</p>

<p>"You make me quite impatient," said a friend of
mine, to whom I read out this remark: "you are continually
opposing the passionate man to the Don Juan,
and that is not the point in dispute. You would be right,
if a man could provide himself with passion at will.
But what about indifference&mdash;what is to be done then?"&mdash;Gallant-love
without horrors. Its horrors always come
from a little soul, that needs to be reassured as to
its own merit.</p>

<p>To continue.&mdash;The Don Juans must find great difficulty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>in agreeing with what I was saying just now of
this state of the soul. Besides the fact that they can
neither see nor feel this state, it gives too great a blow
to their vanity. The error of their life is expecting to
win in a fortnight what a timid lover can scarcely
obtain in six months. They base their reckoning on
experience got at the expense of those poor devils, who
have neither the soul to please a woman of feeling by
revealing its ingenuous workings, nor the necessary wit
for the part of a Don Juan. They refuse to see that the
same prize, though granted by the same woman, is not
the same thing.</p>

<p>Passion-love in the eyes of a Don Juan may be compared
to a strange road, steep and toilsome, that begins,
'tis true, amidst delicious copses, but is soon lost among
sheer rocks, whose aspect is anything but inviting to
the eyes of the vulgar. Little by little the road penetrates
into the mountain-heights, in the midst of a dark
forest, where the huge trees, intercepting the daylight
with their shaggy tops that seem to touch the sky, throw
a kind of horror into souls untempered by dangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>After wandering with difficulty, as in an endless maze,
whose multiple turnings try the patience of our self-love,
on a sudden we turn a corner and find ourselves in a
new world, in the delicious valley of Cashmire of Lalla
Rookh. How can the Don Juans, who never venture
along this road, or at most take but a few steps along it,
judge of the views that it offers at the end of the
journey?...</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>So you see inconstancy is good:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Il me faut du nouveau, n'en fût-il plus au monde."<a name="FNanchor_13_237" id="FNanchor_13_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_237" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Very well, I reply, you make light of oaths and justice,
and what can you look for in inconstancy? Pleasure apparently.</p>

<p>But the pleasure to be got from a pretty woman,
desired a fortnight and loved three months, is different
from the pleasure to be found in a mistress, desired three
years and loved ten.</p>

<p>If I do not insert the word "always" the reason is that I
have been told old age, by altering our organs, renders
us incapable of loving; myself, I don't believe it. When
your mistress has become your intimate friend, she can
give you new pleasures, the pleasures of old age. 'Tis a
flower that, after it has been a rose in the morning&mdash;the
season of flowers&mdash;becomes a delicious fruit in the
evening, when the roses are no longer in season.<a name="FNanchor_14_238" id="FNanchor_14_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_238" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>A mistress desired three years is really a mistress in
every sense of the word; you cannot approach her
without trembling; and let me tell the Don Juans that
a man who trembles is not bored. The pleasures of love
are always in proportion to our fear.</p>

<p>The evil of inconstancy is weariness; the evil of
passion is despair and death. The cases of despair are
noted and become legend. No one pays attention to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>weary old libertines dying of boredom, with whom the
streets of Paris are lined.</p>

<p>"Love blows out more brains than boredom." I have
no doubt of it: boredom robs a man of everything, even
the courage to kill himself.</p>

<p>There is a certain type of character which can find
pleasure only in variety. A man who cries up Champagne
at the expense of Bordeaux is only saying, with
more or less eloquence: "I prefer Champagne."</p>

<p>Each of these wines has its partisans, and they are all
right, so long as they quite understand themselves, and
run after the kind of happiness best suited to their organs<a name="FNanchor_15_239" id="FNanchor_15_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_239" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
and their habits. What ruins the case for inconstancy is
that all fools range themselves on that side from lack of
courage.</p>

<p>But after all, everyone, if he will take the trouble to
look into himself, has his ideal, and there always seems to
me something a little ridiculous in wanting to convert
your neighbour.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_225" id="Footnote_1_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_225"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> See the first volume of the <i>Nouvelle Héloïse</i>. I should say every
volume, if Saint-Preux had happened to have the ghost of a character,
but he was a real poet, a babbler without resolution, who had no courage
until he had made a peroration&mdash;yes, a very dull man. Such men have
an immense advantage, in not upsetting feminine pride, and in never
giving their mistress a fright. Weigh the word well; it contains perhaps
the whole secret of the success of dull men with distinguished women.
Nevertheless love is only a passion in so far as it makes one forget one's
self-love. Thus they do not completely know love, these women, who,
like L., ask of it the pleasures of pride. Unconsciously, they are on the
same level as the prosaic man, the object of their contempt, who in love
seeks love plus vanity. And they too, they want love and pride; but
love goes out with flaming cheeks; he is the proudest of despots; he
will be all, or nothing.</p></div>

<h3>SCATTERED FRAGMENTS</h3>


<p>Under this title, which I would willingly have
made still more modest, I have brought together,
without excessive severity, a selection made from three
or four hundred playing cards, on which I found a few
lines scrawled in pencil. That which, I suppose, must
be called the original manuscript, for want of a simpler
name, was in many places made up of pieces of paper of
all sizes, written on in pencil, and joined together by
Lisio with sealing-wax, to save him the trouble of copying
them afresh. He told me once that nothing he ever
noted down seemed to him worth the trouble of recopying
an hour later. I have entered so fully into all this in
the hope that it may serve as an excuse for repetitions.</p>


<h5>I</h5>

<p>Everything can be acquired in solitude, except character.</p>


<h5>II</h5>

<p>1821. Hatred, love and avarice, the three ruling
passions at Rome, and with gambling added, almost
the only ones.</p>

<p>At first sight the Romans seem ill-natured, but they
are only very much on their guard and blessed with an
imagination which flares up at the least suggestion.</p>

<p>If they give a gratuitous proof of ill-nature, it is the
case of a man, gnawed by fear, and testing his gun to
reassure himself.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<h5>III</h5>

<p>If I were to say, as I believe, that good-nature is the
keynote of the Parisian's character, I should be very
frightened of having offended him.&mdash;"I won't be
good!"</p>


<h5>IV</h5>

<p>A proof of love comes to light, when all the pleasures
and all the pains, which all the other passions and wants
of man can produce, in a moment cease working.</p>


<h5>V</h5>

<p>Prudery is a kind of avarice&mdash;the worst of all.</p>


<h5>VI</h5>

<p>To have a solid character is to have a long and tried
experience of life's disillusions and misfortunes. Then
it is a question of desiring constantly or not at all.</p>


<h5>VII</h5>

<p>Love, such as it exists in smart society, is the love of
battle, the love of gambling.</p>


<h5>VIII</h5>

<p>Nothing kills gallant love like gusts of passion-love
from the other side. (Contessina L. Forlì&mdash;1819).</p>


<h5>IX</h5>

<p>A great fault in women, and the most offensive of all
to a man a little worthy of that name: The public, in
matters of feeling, never soars above mean ideas, and
women make the public the supreme judge of their
lives&mdash;even the most distinguished women, I maintain,
often unconsciously, and even while believing and saying
the contrary. (Brescia, 1819).</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<h5>X</h5>

<p>Prosaic is a new word, which once I thought absurd,
for nothing could be colder than our poetry. If there
has been any warmth in France for the last fifty years, it
is assuredly to be found in its prose.</p>

<p>But anyhow, the little Countess L&mdash;&mdash; used the word
and I like writing it.</p>

<p>The definition of prosaic is to be got from <i>Don
Quixote</i>, and "the complete contrast of Knight and
Squire." The Knight tall and pale; the Squire fat and
fresh. The former all heroism and courtesy; the latter
all selfishness and servility. The former always full of
romantic and touching fancies; the latter a model of
worldly wisdom, a compendium of wise saws. The one
always feeding his soul on dreams of heroism and daring;
the other ruminating some really sensible scheme in
which, never fear, he will take into strict account all
the shameful, selfish little movements the human heart
is prone to.</p>

<p>At the very moment when the former should be
brought to his senses by the non-success of yesterday's
dreams, he is already busy on his castles in Spain for
to-day.</p>

<p>You ought to have a prosaic husband and to choose a
romantic lover.</p>

<p>Marlborough had a prosaic soul: Henry IV, in love at
fifty-five with a young princess, who could not forget
his age, a romantic heart.<a name="FNanchor_1_240" id="FNanchor_1_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_240" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>There are fewer prosaic beings among the nobility
than in the middle-class.</p>

<p>This is the fault of trade, it makes people prosaic.</p>

<h5>XI</h5>

<p>Nothing so interesting as passion: for there everything
is unforeseen, and the principal is the victim.
Nothing so flat as gallantry, where everything is a matter
of calculation, as in all the prosaic affairs of life.</p>


<h5>XII</h5>

<p>At the end of a visit you always finish by treating a
lover better than you meant to. (L., <i>November 2nd</i>, 1818).</p>


<h5>XIII</h5>

<p>In spite of genius in an upstart, the influence of rank
always makes itself felt. Think of Rousseau losing his
heart to all the "ladies" he met, and weeping tears of
rapture because the Duke of L&mdash;&mdash;, one of the dullest
courtiers of the period, deigns to take the right side
rather than the left in a walk with a certain M. Coindet,
friend of Rousseau! (L., <i>May 3rd</i>, 1820.)</p>


<h5>XIV</h5>

<p>Women's only educator is the world. A mother in love
does not hesitate to appear in the seventh heaven of
delight, or in the depth of despair, before her daughters
aged fourteen or fifteen. Remember that, under these
happy skies, plenty of women are quite nice-looking till
forty-five, and the majority are married at eighteen.</p>

<p>Think of La Valchiusa saying yesterday of Lampugnani:
"Ah, that man was made for me, he could love, ...
etc., etc," and so on in this strain to a friend&mdash;all before
her daughter, a little thing of fourteen or fifteen, very
much on the alert, and whom she also took with her on
the more than friendly walks with the lover in question.</p>

<p>Sometimes girls get hold of sound rules of conduct,
For examples take Madame Guarnacci, addressing her
two daughters and two men, who have never called on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>her before. For an hour and a half she treats them to
profound maxims, based on examples within their own
knowledge (that of La Cercara in Hungary), on the precise
point at which it is right to punish with infidelity a
lover who misbehaves himself. (Ravenna, <i>January 23rd</i>,
1820.)</p>


<h5>XV</h5>

<p>The sanguine man, the true Frenchman (Colonel
M&mdash;&mdash;) instead of being tormented by excess of feeling,
like Rousseau, if he has a rendezvous for the next evening
at seven, sees everything, right up to the blessed moment,
through rosy spectacles. People of this kind are not in
the least susceptible to passion-love; it would upset
their sweet tranquillity. I will go so far as to say that
perhaps they would find its transports a nuisance, or at
all events be humiliated by the timidity it produces.</p>


<h5>XVI</h5>

<p>Most men of the world, through vanity, caution or
disaster, let themselves love a woman freely only after
intimate intercourse.</p>


<h5>XVII</h5>

<p>With very gentle souls a woman needs to be easy-going
in order to encourage crystallisation.</p>


<h5>XVIII</h5>

<p>A woman imagines that the voice of the public is
speaking through the mouth of the first fool or the first
treacherous friend who claims to be its faithful interpreter
to her.</p>


<h5>XIX</h5>

<p>There is a delicious pleasure in clasping in your arms
a woman who has wronged you grievously, who has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>your bitter enemy for many a day, and is ready to be so
again. Good fortune of the French officers in Spain,
1812.</p>


<h5>XX</h5>

<p>Solitude is what one wants, to relish one's own heart
and to love; but to succeed one must go amongst men,
here, there and everywhere.</p>


<h5>XXI</h5>

<p>"All the observations of the French on love are well
written, carefully and without exaggeration, but they
bear only on light affections," said that delightful person,
Cardinal Lante.</p>


<h5>XXII</h5>

<p>In Goldoni's comedy, the <i>Innamorati</i>, all the workings
of passion are excellent; it is the very repulsive meanness
of style and thought which revolts one. The contrary is
true of a French comedy.</p>


<h5>XXIII</h5>

<p>The youth of 1822: To say "serious turn of mind,
active disposition" means "sacrifice of the present to
the future." Nothing develops the soul like the power
and the habit of making such sacrifices. I foresee the
probability of more great passions in 1832 than in 1772.</p>


<h5>XXIV</h5>

<p>The choleric temperament, when it does not display
itself in too repulsive a form, is one perhaps most apt of
all to strike and keep alive the imagination of women.
If the choleric temperament does not fall among
propitious surroundings, as Lauzun in Saint-Simon
(Memoirs), the difficulty is to grow used to it. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>once grasped by a woman, this character must fascinate
her: yes, even the savage and fanatic Balfour (<i>Old
Mortality</i>). For women it is the antithesis of the
prosaic.</p>


<h5>XXV</h5>

<p>In love one often doubts what one believes most
strongly (La R., 355). In every other passion, what once
we have proved, we no longer doubt.</p>


<h5>XXVI</h5>

<p>Verse was invented to assist the memory. Later it
was kept to increase the pleasure of reading by the sight
of the difficulty overcome. Its survival nowadays in
dramatic art is a relic of barbarity. Example: the
Cavalry Regulations put into verse by M. de Bonnay.</p>


<h5>XXVII</h5>

<p>While this jealous slave feeds his soul on boredom,
avarice, hatred and other such poisonous, cold passions, I
spend a night of happiness dreaming of her&mdash;of her who,
through mistrust, treats me badly.</p>


<h5>XXVIII</h5>

<p>It needs a great soul to dare have a simple style. That
is why Rousseau put so much rhetoric into the <i>Nouvelle
Héloïse</i>&mdash;which makes it unreadable for anyone over
thirty.</p>


<h5>XXIX</h5>

<p>"The greatest reproach we could possibly make against
ourselves is, certainly, to have let fade, like the shadowy
phantoms produced by sleep, the ideas of honour and
justice, which from time to time well up in our hearts."
(<i>Letter from Jena, March</i>, 1819.)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<h5>XXX</h5>

<p>A respectable woman is in the country and passes an
hour in the hot-house with her gardener. Certain people,
whose views she has upset, accuse her of having found a
lover in this gardener. What answer is there?</p>

<p>Speaking absolutely, the thing is possible. She could
say: "My character speaks for me, look at my behaviour
throughout life"&mdash;only all this is equally invisible to the
eyes of the ill-natured who won't see, and the fools who
can't. (Salviati, Rome, <i>July 23rd</i>, 1819.)</p>


<h5>XXXI</h5>

<p>I have known a man find out that his rival's love was
returned, and yet the rival himself remain blinded to
the fact by his passion.</p>


<h5>XXXII</h5>

<p>The more desperately he is in love, the more violent
the pressure a man is forced to put upon himself, in order
to risk annoying the woman he loves by taking her hand.</p>


<h5>XXXIII</h5>

<p>Ludicrous rhetoric but, unlike that of Rousseau, inspired
by true passion. (Memoirs of M. de Mau...,
<i>Letter of S&mdash;&mdash;</i>.)</p>


<h5>XXXIV</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Naturalness</span></p>

<p>I saw, or I thought I saw, this evening the triumph of
naturalness in a young woman, who certainly seems to
me to possess a great character. She adores, obviously,
I think, one of her cousins and must have confessed to
herself the state of her heart. The cousin is in love with
her, but as she is very serious with him, thinks she does
not like him, and lets himself be fascinated by the marks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>of preference shown him by Clara, a young widow and
friend of Mélanie. I think he will marry her. Mélanie
sees it and suffers all that a proud heart, struggling involuntarily
with a violent passion, is capable of suffering.
She has only to alter her ways a little; but she would
look upon it as a piece of meanness, the consequences of
which would affect her whole life, to depart one instant
from her natural self.</p>


<h5>XXXV</h5>

<p>Sappho saw in love only sensual intoxication or physical
pleasure made sublime by crystallisation. Anacreon
looked for sensual and intellectual amusement. There
was too little security in Antiquity for people to find
leisure for passion-love.</p>


<h5>XXXVI</h5>

<p>The foregoing fact fully justifies me in rather laughing
at people who think Homer superior to Tasso. Passion-love
did exist in the time of Homer, and at no great
distance from Greece.</p>


<h5>XXXVII</h5>

<p>Woman with a heart, if you wish to know whether the
man you adore loves you with passion-love, study your
lover's early youth. Every man of distinction in the
early days of his life is either a ridiculous enthusiast or
an unfortunate. A man easy to please, of gay and cheerful
humour, can never love with the passion your heart
requires.</p>

<p>Passion I call only that which has gone through long
misfortunes, misfortunes which novels take good care
not to depict&mdash;what's more they can't!</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<h5>XXXVIII</h5>

<p>A bold resolution can change in an instant the most
extreme misfortune into quite a tolerable state of things.
The evening of a defeat, a man is retreating in hot
haste, his charger already spent. He can hear distinctly
the troop of cavalry galloping in pursuit. Suddenly
he stops, dismounts, recharges his carbine and
pistols, and makes up his mind to defend himself.
Straightway, instead of having death, he has a cross of
the Legion of Honour before his eyes.</p>


<h5>XXXIX</h5>

<p>Basis of English habits. About 1730, while we already
had Voltaire and Fontenelle, a machine was invented in
England to separate the grain, after threshing, from the
chaff. It worked by means of a wheel, which gave the
air enough movement to blow away the bits of chaff.
But in that biblical country the peasants pretended that
it was wicked to go against the will of Divine Providence,
and to produce an artificial wind like this, instead of
begging Heaven with an ardent prayer for enough wind
to thresh the corn and waiting for the moment appointed
by the God of Israel. Compare this with
French peasants.<a name="FNanchor_1_241" id="FNanchor_1_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_241" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1_241" id="Footnote_1_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_241"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> For the actual state of English habits, see the Life of Mr. Beattie,
written by an intimate friend. The reader will be edified by the profound
humility of Mr. Beattie, when he receives ten guineas from an old
Marchioness in order to slander Hume. The trembling aristocracy relies
on the bishops with incomes of £200,000, and pays in money and honour
so-called liberal writers to throw mud at Chénier. (<i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
1821.)
</p>
<p>
The most disgusting cant leaks through on all sides. Everything
except the portrayal of primitive and energetic feelings is stifled by it:
impossible to write a joyous page in English.</p></div>

<h5>XL</h5>

<p>No doubt about it&mdash;'tis a form of madness to expose
oneself to passion-love. In some cases, however, the cure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>works too energetically. American girls in the United
States are so saturated and fortified with reasonable ideas,
that in that country love, the flower of life, has deserted
youth. At Boston a girl can be left perfectly safely alone
with a handsome stranger&mdash;in all probability she's thinking
of nothing but her marriage settlement.</p>


<h5>XLI</h5>

<p>In France men who have lost their wives are melancholy;
widows, on the contrary, merry and light-hearted.
There is a proverb current among women on
the felicity of this state. So there must be some inequality
in the articles of union.</p>


<h5>XLII</h5>

<p>People who are happy in their love have an air of profound
preoccupation, which, for a Frenchman, is the
same as saying an air of profound gloom. (Dresden,
1818.)</p>


<h5>XLIII</h5>

<p>The more generally a man pleases, the less deeply can
he please.</p>


<h5>XLIV</h5>

<p>As a result of imitation in the early years of life, we
contract the passions of our parents, even when these
very passions poison our life. (L.'s pride.)</p>


<h5>XLV</h5>

<p>The most honourable source of feminine pride is a
woman's fear of degrading herself in her lover's eyes by
some hasty step or some action that he may think unwomanly.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<h5>XLVI</h5>

<p>Real love renders the thought of death frequent,
agreeable, unterrifying, a mere subject of comparison,
the price we are willing to pay for many a thing.</p>


<h5>XLVII</h5>

<p>How often have I exclaimed for all my bravery: "If
anyone would blow out my brains, I'd thank him before
I expired, if there were time." A man can only be brave,
with the woman he loves, by loving her a little less.
(S., <i>February</i>, 1820.)</p>


<h5>XLVIII</h5>

<p>"I could never love!" a young woman said to me.
"Mirabeau and his letters to Sophie have given me a
disgust for great souls. Those fatal letters impressed
me like a personal experience."</p>

<p>Try a plan which you never read of in novels; let
two years' constancy assure you, before intimate intercourse,
of your lover's heart.</p>


<h5>XLIX</h5>

<p>Ridicule scares love. Ridicule is impossible in Italy:
what's good form in Venice is odd at Naples&mdash;consequently
nothing's odd in Italy. Besides, nothing that
gives pleasure is found fault with. 'Tis this that does
away with the fool's honour and half the farce.</p>

<h5>L</h5>

<p>Children command by tears, and if people do not
attend to their wishes, they hurt themselves on purpose.
Young women are piqued from a sense of honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>'Tis a common reflection, but one for that reason
easily forgotten, that every day sensitive souls become

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Feminine Pride</span></p>

<p>I have just witnessed a striking example&mdash;but on
mature consideration I should need fifteen pages to give
a proper idea of it. If I dared, I would much rather
note the consequences; my eyes have convinced me
beyond the possibility of doubt. But, no, it is a conviction
I must give up all idea of communicating, there
are too many little details. Such pride is the opposite
of French vanity. So far as I can remember, the only
work, in which I have seen a sketch of it, is that part of
Madame Roland's Memoirs, where she recounts the
petty reasonings she made as a girl. (Bologna, <i>April 18th</i>,
2 a.m.)</p>

<h5>LIII</h5>

<p>In France, most women make no account of a young
man until they have turned him into a coxcomb. It is
only then that he can flatter their vanity. (Duclos.)</p>

<h5>LIV</h5>

<p>Zilietti said to me at midnight (at the charming
Marchesina R...'s): "I'm not going to dine at San
Michele (an inn). Yesterday I said some smart things&mdash;I
was joking with Cl...; it might make me conspicuous."</p>

<p>Don't go and think that Zilietti is either a fool or a
coward. He is a prudent and very rich man in this
happy land. (Modena, 1820.)</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<h5>LV</h5>

<p>What is admirable in America is the government, not
society. Elsewhere government does the harm. At
Boston they have changed parts, and government plays
the hypocrite, in order not to shock society.</p>

<h5>LVI</h5>

<p>Italian girls, if they love, are entirely given over to
natural inspiration. At the very most all that can
aid them is a handful of excellent maxims, which
they have picked up by listening at the keyhole. As
if fate had decreed that everything here should combine
to preserve naturalness, they read no novels&mdash;and
for this reason, that there are none. At Geneva or in
France, on the contrary, a girls falls in love at sixteen in
order to be a heroine, and at each step, almost at each
tear, she asks herself: "Am I not just like Julie d'Étanges? "</p>

<h5>LVII</h5>

<p>The husband of a young woman adored by a lover,
whom she treats unkindly and scarcely allows to kiss her
hand, has, at the very most, only the grossest physical
pleasure, where the lover would find the charms and
transports of the keenest happiness that exists on earth.</p>

<h5>LVIII</h5>

<p>The laws of the imagination are still so little understood,
that I include the following estimate, though
perhaps it is all quite wrong.</p>

<p>I seem to distinguish two sorts of imagination:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Imagination like Fabio's, ardent, impetuous, inconsiderate,
leading straight to action, consuming itself,
and already languishing at a delay of twenty-four hours.
Impatience is its prime characteristic; it becomes enraged
against that which it cannot obtain. It sees all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>exterior objects, but they only serve to inflame it. It
assimilates them to its own substance, and converts them
straight away to the profit of passion.</p>

<p>2. Imagination which takes fire slowly and little by
little, but which loses in time the perception of exterior
objects, and comes to find occupation and nourishment
in nothing but its own passion. This last sort of imagination
goes quite easily with slowness, or even scarcity, of
ideas. It is favourable to constancy. It is the imagination
of the greater part of those poor German girls, who
are dying of love and consumption. That sad spectacle,
so frequent beyond the Rhine, is never met with in Italy.</p>

<h5>LIX</h5>

<p>Imaginative habits. A Frenchman is really shocked by
eight changes of scenery in one act of a tragedy. Such
a man is incapable of pleasure in seeing Macbeth. He
consoles himself by damning Shakespeare.</p>

<h5>LX</h5>

<p>In France the provinces are forty years behind Paris
in all that regards women. A. C., a married woman,
tells me that she only liked to read certain parts of
Lanzi's Memoirs. Such stupidity is too much for me; I
can no longer find a word to say to her. As if that were
a book one <i>could</i> put down!</p>

<p>Want of naturalness&mdash;the great failing in provincial
women.</p>

<p>Their effusive and gracious gestures; those who play
the first fiddle in the town are worse than the others.</p>

<h5>LXI</h5>

<p>Goethe, or any other German genius, esteems money
at what it's worth. Until he has got an income of
six thousand francs, he must think of nothing but his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>banking-account. After that he must never think of it
again. The fool, on his side, does not understand the
advantage there is of feeling and thinking like Goethe.
All his life he feels in terms of money and thinks of sums
of money. It is owing to this support from both sides,
that the prosaic in this world seem to come off so much
better than the high-minded.</p>

<h5>LXII</h5>

<p>In Europe, desire is inflamed by constraint; in America
it is dulled by liberty.</p>

<h5>LXIII</h5>

<p>A mania for discussion has got hold of the younger
generation and stolen it from love. While they are
considering whether Napoleon was of service to France,
they let the age of love speed past. Even with those
who mean to be young, it is all affectation&mdash;a tie, a spur,
their martial swagger, their all-absorbing self&mdash;and they
forget to cast a glance at the girl who passes by so
modestly and cannot go out more than once a week
through want of means.</p>

<h5>LXIV</h5>

<p>I have suppressed a chapter on Prudery, and others as
well.</p>

<p>I am happy to find the following passage in Horace
Walpole's Memoirs:</p>

<p><i>The Two Elizabeths</i>. Let us compare the daughters of
two ferocious men, and see which was sovereign of a
civilised nation, which of a barbarous one. Both were
Elizabeths. The daughter of Peter (of Russia) was
absolute, yet spared a competitor and a rival; and thought
the person of an empress had sufficient allurements for
as many of her subjects as she chose to honour with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>communication. Elizabeth of England could neither
forgive the claim of Mary Stuart nor her charms, but ungenerously
imprisoned her (as George IV did Napoleon<a name="FNanchor_1_242" id="FNanchor_1_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_242" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>)
when imploring protection, and, without the sanction of
either despotism or law, sacrificed many to her great
and little jealousy. Yet this Elizabeth piqued herself on
chastity; and while she practised every ridiculous art
of coquetry to be admired at an unseemly age, kept off
lovers whom she encouraged, and neither gratified her
own desires nor their ambition. Who can help preferring
the honest, open-hearted barbarian empress? (Lord
Orford's Memoirs.)</p>

</div>

<h5>LXV</h5>

<p>Extreme familiarity may destroy crystallisation. A
charming girl of sixteen fell in love with a handsome
youth of the same age, who never failed one evening to
pass under her window at nightfall. Her mother invites
him to spend a week with them in the country&mdash;a desperate
remedy, I agree. But the girl was romantic, and
the youth rather dull: after three days she despised him.</p>

<h5>LXVI</h5>

<p>Ave Maria&mdash;twilight in Italy, the hour of tenderness,
of the soul's pleasures and of melancholy&mdash;sensation
intensified by the sound of those lovely bells.</p>

<p>Hours of pleasure, which only in memory touch the
senses.... (Bologna, <i>April 17th</i>, 1817.)</p>

<h5>LXVII</h5>

<p>A young man's first love-affair on entering society is
ordinarily one of ambition. He rarely declares his love
for a sweet, amiable and innocent young girl. How
tremble before her, adore her, feel oneself in the presence
of a divinity? Youth must love a being whose qualities
lift him up in his own eyes. It is in the decline of life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>that we sadly come back to love the simple and the
innocent, despairing of the sublime. Between the two
comes true love, which thinks of nothing but itself.</p>

<h5>LXVIII</h5>

<p>The existence of great souls is not suspected. They
hide away; all that is seen is a little originality. There
are more great souls than one would think.</p>

<h5>LXIX</h5>

<p>The first clasp of the beloved's hand&mdash;what a moment
that is! The only joy to be compared to it is the ravishing
joy of power&mdash;which statesmen and kings make pretence
of despising. This joy also has its crystallisation, though
it demands a colder and more reasonable imagination.
Think of a man whom, a quarter of an hour ago, Napoleon
has called to be a minister.</p>

<h5>LXX</h5>

<p>The celebrated Johannes von Müller<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_54" id="TNanch_54"></a><a href="#TN_54">(54)</a></span> said to me
at Cassel in 1808&mdash;Nature has given strength to the
North and wit to the South.</p>

<h5>LXXI</h5>

<p>Nothing more untrue than the maxim: No man is
a hero before his valet. Or, rather, nothing truer in the
monarchic sense of the word hero&mdash;the affected hero, like
Hippolytus in <i>Phèdre</i>. Desaix, for example, would have
been a hero even before his valet (it's true I don't know
if he had one), and a still greater hero for his valet than
for anyone else. Turenne and Fénelon might each have

<p>Here is blasphemy. I, a Dutchman, dare say this:
the French possess neither the true pleasures of conversation
nor the true pleasures of the theatre; instead of
relaxation and complete unrestraint, they mean hard
labour. Among the sources of fatigue which hastened
on the death of Mme. de Staël I have heard counted the
strain of conversation during her last winter.<a name="FNanchor_1_243" id="FNanchor_1_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_243" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In France, any idea that can be explained only in the

<p>Suppose you are passionately in love with a woman
and that your imagination has not run dry. One evening
she is tactless enough to say, looking at you tenderly and
abashed: "Er&mdash;yes&mdash;come to-morrow at midday; I
shall be in to no one but you." You cannot sleep; you

win a man's approval; there you see a whole world acting
without morality and, what's more, without passion.
All this added to the presence of the women with their
very low dresses and their expression of malice, greeting
with a sardonic smile everything but selfish advantage
payable in the hard cash of solid pleasures&mdash;why! it
gives the idea of scenes from the Bagno. It drives far
away all doubts suggested by virtue or the conscious
satisfaction of a heart at peace with itself. Yet I have
seen the feeling of isolation amidst all this dispose gentle
hearts to love. (<i>Mars at the Tuileries</i>, 1811.)</p>

wholly relative to the gain and safe-keeping of just

<p>It was a mistake of the greatest philosopher that
France has had, not to have stayed in some Alpine
solitude, in some remote abode, thence to launch his
book on Paris without ever coming there himself<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_58" id="TNanch_58"></a><a href="#TN_58">(58)</a></span>.
Seeing Helvétius so simple and straightforward, unnatural,
hot-house people like Suard, Marmontel or
Diderot could never imagine they had a great philosopher
before them. They were perfectly honest in
their contempt for his profound reason. First of all, it
was simple&mdash;a fault unpardonable in France; secondly,
the author, not, of course, his book, was lowered in
value by this weakness&mdash;the extreme importance he
attached to getting what in France is called glory, to
being, like Balzac, Voiture or Fontenelle, the fashion
among his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Rousseau had too much feeling and too little logic,
Buffon, in his Botanical Garden, was too hypocritical, and
Voltaire too paltry to be able to judge the principle
of Helvétius.</p>

<p>Helvétius was guilty of a little slip in calling this
principle <i>interest</i>, instead of giving it a pretty name like
<i>pleasure</i>;<a name="FNanchor_1_244" id="FNanchor_1_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_244" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but what are we to think of a nation's
literature, which shows its sense by letting itself be
led astray by a fault so slight?</p>

<p>The ordinary clever man, Prince Eugene of Savoy for
example, finding himself in the position of Regulus,
would have stayed quietly at Rome, and even laughed at
the stupidity of the Carthaginian Senate. Regulus goes
back to Carthage. Prince Eugene would have been
prosecuting his own interest, and in exactly the same way
Regulus was prosecuting his.</p>

<p>All through life a noble spirit is seeing possibilities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>of action, of which a common spirit can form no
idea. The very second the possibility of that action
becomes visible to the noble spirit, it is its interest
thus to act.</p>

<p>If this noble spirit did not perform the action, which
it has just perceived, it would despise itself&mdash;it would be
unhappy. Man's duties are in the ratio of his moral
range. The principle of Helvétius holds good, even in
the wildest exaltations of love, even in suicide. It is
contrary to his nature, it is an impossibility for a man not
to do, always and at any moment you choose to take, that
which is possible and which gives him most pleasure at
that moment to do.</p>

<p>No posthumous love-letters of Roman ladies have been
printed. Petronius has written a charming book, but it
is only debauch that he has painted.</p>

<p>For love at Rome, apart from Virgil's story of Dido<a name="FNanchor_1_245" id="FNanchor_1_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_245" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and his second Eclogue, we have no evidence more
precise than the writings of the three great poets, Ovid,
Tibullus and Propertius.</p>

<p>Now, Parny's <i>Elegies</i> or Colardeau's <i>Letter of Héloïse to
Abelard</i> are pictures of a very imperfect and vague kind,
if you compare them to some of the letters in the <i>Nouvelle
Héloïse</i>, to those of the Portuguese Nun, of Mademoiselle
de Lespinasse, of Mirabeau's Sophie, of Werther,
etc., etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>Poetry, with its obligatory comparisons, its mythology
in which the poet doesn't believe, its dignity of style <i>à la</i>
Louis XIV, and all its superfluous stock of ornaments
called poetical, is very inferior to prose when it comes
to a question of giving a clear and precise idea of the
working of the heart. And, in this class of writing,
clearness alone is effective.</p>

<p>Tibullus, Ovid and Propertius had better taste than
our poets; they have painted love such as it was to be
found among the proud citizens of Rome: moreover,
they lived under Augustus, who, having shut the
temple of Janus, sought to debase these citizens to the
condition of the loyal subjects of a monarchy.</p>

<p>The mistresses of these three great poets were coquettes,
faithless and venal women; in their company the poets
only sought physical pleasure, and never, I should think,
caught a glimpse of the sublime sentiments<a name="FNanchor_2_246" id="FNanchor_2_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_246" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which,
thirteen centuries later, stirred the heart of the gentle
Héloïse.</p>

<p>I borrow the following passage from a distinguished
man of letters,<a name="FNanchor_3_247" id="FNanchor_3_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_247" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and one who knows the Latin poets much
better than I do:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The brilliant genius of Ovid, the rich imagination of Propertius,
the impressionable heart of Tibullus, doubtless inspired
them with verses of a different flavour, but all, in the same manner,
they loved women of much the same kind. They desire,
they triumph, they have fortunate rivals, they are jealous, they
quarrel and make it up; they are faithless in their turn, they are
forgiven; and they recover their happiness only to be ruffled by
the return of the same mischances.</p>

<p>Corinna is married. The first lessons that Ovid gives her are
to teach her the address with which to deceive her husband:
the signs they are to make each other before him and in society,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>so that they can understand each other and be understood only by
themselves. Enjoyment quickly follows; afterwards quarrels, and,
what you wouldn't expect from so gallant a man as Ovid, insults
and blows; then excuses, tears and forgiveness. Sometimes he
addresses himself to subordinates&mdash;to the servants, to his mistress'
porter, who is to open to him at night, to a cursed old beldam who
corrupts her and teaches her to sell herself for gold, to an old
eunuch who keeps watch over her, to a slave-girl who is to convey
the tablets in which he begs for a rendezvous. The rendezvous
is refused: he curses his tablets, that have had such sorry fortune.
Fortune shines brighter: he adjures the dawn not to come to
interrupt his happiness.</p>

<p>Soon he accuses himself of numberless infidelities, of his
indiscriminate taste for women. A moment after, Corinna is
herself faithless; he cannot bear the idea that he has given her
lessons from which she reaps the profit with someone else. Corinna
in her turn is jealous; she abuses him like a fury rather than a
gentle woman; she accuses him of loving a slave-girl. He swears
that there is nothing in it and writes to the slave&mdash;yet everything
that made Corinna angry was true. But how did she get
to know of it? What clue had led to their betrayal? He asks
the slave-girl for another rendezvous. If she refuse him, he
threatens to confess everything to Corinna. He jokes with a
friend about his two loves and the trouble and pleasure they give
him. Soon after, it is Corinna alone that fills his thoughts. She
is everything to him. He sings his triumph, as if it were his first
victory. After certain incidents, which for more than one reason
we must leave in Ovid, and others, which it would be too long to
recount, he discovers that Corinna's husband has become too lax.
He is no longer jealous; our lover does not like this, and threatens
to leave the wife, if the husband does not resume his jealousy. The
husband obeys him but too well; he has Corinna watched so
closely, that Ovid can no longer come to her. He complains of
this close watch, which he had himself provoked&mdash;but he will find
a way to get round it. Unfortunately, he is not the only one to succeed
therein. Corinna's infidelities begin again and multiply; her
intrigues become so public, that the only boon that Ovid can
crave of her, is that she will take some trouble to deceive him, and
show a little less obviously what she really is. Such were the
morals of Ovid and his mistress, such is the character of their love.</p>

<p>Cynthia is the first love of Propertius, and she will be his last.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>No sooner is he happy, but he is jealous. Cynthia is too fond of
dress; he begs her to shun luxury and to love simplicity. He
himself is given up to more than one kind of debauch. Cynthia
expects him; he only comes to her at dawn, leaving a banquet in
his cups. He finds her asleep; it is a long time before she wakes,
in spite of the noise he makes and even of his kisses; at last she
opens her eyes and reproaches him as he deserves. A friend tries
to detach him from Cynthia; he gives his friend a eulogy of her
beauty and talents. He is threatened with losing her; she goes
off with a soldier; she means to follow the army; she will expose
herself to every danger in order to follow her soldier. Propertius
does not storm; he weeps and prays heaven for her happiness.
He will never leave the house she has deserted; he will look out
for strangers who have seen her, and will never leave off asking
them for news of Cynthia. She is touched by love so great. She
deserts the soldier and stays with the poet. He gives thanks to
Apollo and the Muses; he is drunk with his happiness. This
happiness is soon troubled by a new access of jealousy, interrupted
by separation and by absence. Far from Cynthia, he can
only think of her. Her past infidelities make him fear for news.
Death does not frighten him, he only fears to lose Cynthia; let
him be but certain that she will be faithful and he will go down
without regret to the grave.</p>

<p>After more treachery, he fancies he is delivered from his love;
but soon he is again in its bonds. He paints the most ravishing
portrait of his mistress, her beauty, the elegance of her dress,
her talents in singing, poetry and dancing; everything redoubles
and justifies his love. But Cynthia, as perverse as she is captivating,
dishonours herself before the whole town by such scandalous
adventures that Propertius can no longer love her without shame.
He blushes, but he cannot shake her off. He will be her lover,
her husband; he will never love any but Cynthia. They part
and come together again. Cynthia is jealous, he reassures her.
He will never love any other woman. But in fact it is never one
woman he loves&mdash;it is all women. He never has enough of them,
he is insatiable of pleasure. To recall him to himself, Cynthia
has to desert him yet again. Then his complaints are as vigorous
as if he had never been faithless himself. He tries to escape. He
seeks distraction in debauch.&mdash;Is he drunk as usual? He pretends
that a troupe of loves meets him and brings him back to Cynthia's
feet. Reconciliation is followed by more storms. Cynthia, at one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>of their supper parties, gets heated with wine like himself, upsets
the table and hits him over the head. Propertius thinks this
charming. More perfidy forces him at last to break his chains;
he tries to go away; he means to travel in Greece; he completes
all his plans for the journey, but he renounces the project&mdash;and
all in order to see himself once more the butt of new outrages.
Cynthia does not confine herself to betraying him; she makes
him the laughing-stock of his rivals. But illness seizes her and
she dies. She reproaches him with his faithlessness, his caprices
and his desertion of her in her last moments, and swears that she
herself, in spite of appearances, was always faithful.</p>

<p>Such are the morals and adventures of Propertius and his
mistress; such in abstract is the history of their love. Such was
the woman that a soul like Propertius was reduced to loving.</p>

<p>Ovid and Propertius were often faithless, but never inconstant.
Confirmed libertines, they distribute their homage far and wide,
but always return to take up the same chains again. Corinna
and Cynthia have womankind for rivals, but no woman in particular.
The Muse of these two poets is faithful, if their love is
not, and no other names besides those of Corinna and of Cynthia
figure in their verses. Tibullus, a tender lover and tender poet,
less lively and less headlong in his tastes, has not their constancy.
Three beauties are one after the other the objects of his love and
of his verses. Delia is the first, the most celebrated and also the
best beloved. Tibullus has lost his fortune, but he still has the
country and Delia. To enjoy her amid the peaceful fields; to
be able, at his ease, to press Delia's hand in his; to have her
for his only mourner at his funeral&mdash;he makes no other prayers.
Delia is kept shut up by a jealous husband; he will penetrate into
her prison, in spite of any Argus and triple bolts. He will forget
all his troubles in her arms. He falls ill and Delia alone fills his
thoughts. He exhorts her to be always chaste, to despise gold,
and to grant none but him the love she has granted him. But
Delia does not follow his advice. He thought he could put up
with her infidelity; but it is too much for him and he begs Delia
and Venus for pity. He seeks in wine a remedy and does not
find it; he can neither soften his regret nor cure himself of his
love. He turns to Delia's husband, deceived like himself, and
reveals to him all the tricks she uses to attract and see her lovers.
If the husband does not know how to keep watch over her, let
her be trusted to himself; he will manage right enough to ward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>the lovers off and to keep from their toils the author of their
common wrongs. He is appeased and returns to her; he remembers
Delia's mother who favoured their love; the memory of
this good woman opens his heart once more to tender thoughts,
and all Delia's wrongs are forgotten. But she is soon guilty of
others more serious. She lets herself be corrupted by gold and
presents; she gives herself to another, to others. At length
Tibullus breaks his shameful chains and says good-bye to her for
ever.</p>

<p>He passes under the sway of Nemesis and is no happier; she
loves only gold and cares little for poetry and the gifts of genius.
Nemesis is a greedy woman who sells herself to the highest bidder;
he curses her avarice, but he loves her and cannot live unless she
loves him. He tries to move her with touching images. She has
lost her young sister; he will go and weep on her tomb and
confide his grief to her dumb ashes. The shade of her sister will
take offence at the tears that Nemesis causes to flow. She must
not despise her anger. The sad image of her sister might come
at night to trouble her sleep.... But these sad memories force
tears from Nemesis&mdash;and at that price he could not buy even
happiness. Neaera is his third mistress. He has long enjoyed her
love; he only prays the gods that he may live and die with her;
but she leaves him, she is gone; he can only think of her, she
is his only prayer; he has seen in a dream Apollo, who announces
to him that Neaera is unfaithful. He refuses to believe this dream;
he could not survive his misfortune, and none the less the misfortune
is there. Neaera is faithless; once more Tibullus is
deserted. Such was his character and fortune, such is the triple
and all unhappy story of his loves.</p>

<p>In him particularly there is a sweet, all-pervading melancholy,
that gives even to his pleasures the tone of dreaminess and sadness
which constitutes his charm. If any poet of antiquity introduced
moral sensibility into love, it was Tibullus; but these fine shades
of feeling which he expresses so well, are in himself; he expects
no more than the other two to find them or engender them in his
mistresses. Their grace, their beauty is all that inflames him;
their favours all he desires or regrets; their perfidy, their venality,
their loss, all that torments him. Of all these women, celebrated
in the verses of three great poets, Cynthia seems the most lovable.
The attraction of talent is joined to all the others; she cultivates
singing and poetry; and yet all these talents, which were found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>not infrequently in courtesans of a certain standing, were of no
avail&mdash;it was none the less pleasure, gold and wine which ruled
her. And Propertius, who boasts only once or twice of her
artistic tastes, in his passion for her is none the less seduced by
a very different power!</p></blockquote>

<p>These great poets are apparently to be numbered among
the most tender and refined souls of their century&mdash;well!
this is how they loved and whom. We must here put
literary considerations on one side. I only ask of them
evidence concerning their century; and in two thousand
years a novel by Ducray-Duminil<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_59" id="TNanch_59"></a><a href="#TN_59">(59)</a></span> will be evidence

<p>The Roman feels the beauties of Nature and Art with

Nature, but his logic from government.</p>

<p>London, <i>November 20th</i>, 1821.</p>

<p>A very sensible man, who arrived yesterday from
Madras, told me in a two hours' conversation what I
reduce to the following few lines:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This gloom, which from an unknown cause depresses the English
character, penetrates so deeply into their hearts, that at the end
of the world, at Madras, no sooner does an Englishman get a few
days' holiday, than he quickly leaves rich and flourishing Madras and
comes to revive his spirits in the little French town of Pondicherry,
which, without wealth and almost without commerce, flourishes
under the paternal administration of M. Dupuy. At Madras
you drink Burgundy that costs thirty-six francs a bottle; the
poverty of the French in Pondicherry is such that, in the most
distinguished circles, the refreshments consist of large glasses
of water. But in Pondicherry they laugh.</p></blockquote>

<p>At present there is more liberty in England than in
Prussia. The climate is the same as that of Koenigsberg,
Berlin or Warsaw, cities which are far from being
famous for their gloom. The working classes in these
towns have less security and drink quite as little wine as
in England; and they are much worse clothed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>The aristocracies of Venice and Vienna are not
gloomy.</p>

<p>I can see only one point of difference: in gay countries
the Bible is little read, and there is gallantry. I am sorry
to have to come back so often to a demonstration with
which I am unsatisfied. I suppress a score of facts
pointing in the same direction.</p>

<h5>XCVII</h5>

<p>I have just seen, in a fine country-house near Paris, a
very good-looking, very clever, and very rich young man
of less than twenty; he has been left there by chance
almost alone, for a long time too, with a most beautiful
girl of eighteen, full of talent, of a most distinguished
mind, and also very rich. Who wouldn't have expected a
passionate love-affair? Not a bit of it&mdash;such was the
affectation of these two charming creatures that both
were occupied solely with themselves and the effect they
were to produce.</p>

<h5>XCVIII</h5>

<p>I am ready to agree that on the morrow of a great
action a savage pride has made this people fall into all
the faults and follies that lay open to it. But you will
see what prevents me from effacing my previous praises
of this representative of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>The prettiest woman in Narbonne is a young Spaniard,
scarcely twenty years old, who lives there very retired
with her husband, a Spaniard also, and an officer on half-pay.
Some time ago there was a fool whom this officer
was obliged to insult. The next day, on the field of
combat, the fool sees the young Spanish woman arrive.
He begins a renewed flow of affected nothings:&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, indeed, it's shocking! How could you tell your
wife about it? You see, she has come to prevent us
fighting!" "I have come to bury you," she answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>Happy the husband who can tell his wife everything!
The result did not belie this woman's haughty words.
Her action would have been considered hardly the thing
in England. Thus does false decency diminish the
little happiness that exists here below.</p>

<p>The delightful Donézan said yesterday: "In my
youth, and well on in my career&mdash;for I was fifty in '89&mdash;women
wore powder in their hair.</p>

<p>"I own that a woman without powder gives me a
feeling of repugnance; the first impression is always that
of a chamber-maid who hasn't had time to get dressed."</p>

<p>Here we have the one argument against Shakespeare
and in favour of the dramatic unities.</p>

<p>While young men read nothing but La Harpe<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_61" id="TNanch_61"></a><a href="#TN_61">(61)</a></span>,
the taste for great powdered <i>toupées</i>, such as the late
Queen Marie Antoinette used to wear, can still last some
years. I know people too, who despise Correggio and
Michael Angelo, and, to be sure, M. Donézan was extremely
clever.</p>

<p>Cold, brave, calculating, suspicious, contentious, for
ever afraid of being attracted by anyone who might
possibly be laughing at them in secret, absolutely devoid
of enthusiasm, and a little jealous of people who saw
great events with Napoleon, such was the youth of that
age, estimable rather than lovable. They forced on the
country that Right-Centre form of government-to-the-lowest-bidder.
This temper in the younger generation
was to be found even among the conscripts, each of
whom only longed to finish his time.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Discussion between an Honest Man
and an Academic</span></p>

<p>"In this discussion, the academic always saved himself
by fixing on little dates and other similar errors of small
importance; but the consequences and natural qualifications
of things, these he always denied, or seemed not to
understand: for example, that Nero was a cruel Emperor
or Charles II a perjurer. Now, how are you to prove
things of this kind, or, even if you do, manage not to
put a stop to the general discussion or lose the thread of
it?</p>

<p>"This, I have always remarked, is the method of
discussion between such folk, one of whom seeks only
the truth and advancement thereto, the other the favour
of his master or his party and the glory of talking well.
And I always consider it great folly and waste of time
for an honest man to stop and talk with the said academics."

<p>Only a small part of the art of being happy is an exact

Philadelphia to-day.)</p>

<p>For the rest, the art of being happy is like poetry; in
spite of the perfecting of all things, Homer, two thousand
seven hundred years ago, had more talent than
Lord Byron.</p>

<p>Whence comes the intolerance of Stoic philosophers?
From the same source as that of religious fanatics. They
are put out because they are struggling against nature,
because they deny themselves, and because it hurts them.
If they would question themselves honestly on the hatred
they bear towards those who profess a code of morals
less severe, they would have to own that it springs from
a secret jealousy of a bliss which they envy and have
renounced, without believing in the rewards which would

<p>Women who are always taking offence might well
ask themselves whether they are following a line of conduct,

happiness. Is there not a little lack of courage, mixed

heart? Consider the ill-humour of Madame de Deshoulières
in her last days. (<i>Note by M. Lemontey.</i>)<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_62" id="TNanch_62"></a><a href="#TN_62">(62)</a></span>.</p>

used to talk scandal about the Contessina Vicenzella.
"Well, well!" she would say, "I'm young, free, rich
and perhaps not ugly. I wish the same to all the ladies

months&mdash;the news is just as sensational, and to bring it
up on the fourth day just as tactless. Must every great
capital be like this, or has it to do with the good nature
and light heart of the Parisian? Thanks to aristocratic
pride and morbid reserve, London is nothing but a
numerous collection of hermits; it is not a capital.
Vienna is nothing but an oligarchy of two hundred
families surrounded by a hundred and fifty thousand
workpeople and servants who wait on them. No more

<p>According to common ideas, or reasonable-ideas, as
they are called by ordinary people, if any period of
imprisonment could possibly be tolerable, it would be
after several years' confinement, when at last the poor
prisoner is only separated by a month or two from the
moment of his release. But the ways of crystallisation
are otherwise. The last month is more painful than the
last three years. In the gaol at Melun, M. d'Hotelans
has seen several prisoners die of impatience within a few
months of the day of release.</p>

<p>I cannot resist the pleasure of copying out a letter
written in bad English by a young German woman. It
proves that, after all, constant love exists, and that not every
man of genius is a Mirabeau. Klopstock, the great poet,
passes at Hamburg for having been an attractive person.
Read what his young wife wrote to an intimate friend:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"After having seen him two hours, I was obliged to
pass the evening in a company, which never had been so
wearisome to me. I could not speak, I could not play;
I thought I saw nothing but Klopstock; I saw him the
next day and the following and we were very seriously
friends. But the fourth day he departed. It was a
strong hour the hour of his departure! He wrote soon
after; from that time our correspondence began to be
a very diligent one. I sincerely believed my love to be
friendship. I spoke with my friends of nothing but
Klopstock, and showed his letters. They raillied at me
and said I was in love. I raillied then again, and said
that they must have a very friendshipless heart, if they
had no idea of friendship to a man as well as to a woman.
Thus it continued eight months, in which time my friends
found as much love in Klopstock's letters as in me. I
perceived it likewise, but I would not believe it. At the
last Klopstock said plainly that he loved; and I startled
as for a wrong thing; I answered that it was no love,
but friendship, as it was what I felt for him; we had
not seen one another enough to love (as if love must have
more time than friendship). This was sincerely my
meaning, and I had this meaning till Klopstock came
again to Hamburg. This he did a year after we had seen
one another the first time. We saw, we were friends, we
loved; and a short time after, I could even tell Klopstock
that I loved. But we were obliged to part again,
and wait two years for our wedding. My mother would
not let me marry a stranger. I could marry then without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>her consent, as by the death of my father my fortune
depended not on her; but this was a horrible idea for
me; and thank heaven that I have prevailed by prayers!
At this time knowing Klopstock, she loves him as her
lifely son, and thanks God that she has not persisted.
We married and I am the happiest wife in the world.
In some few months it will be four years that I am so
happy...." (<i>Correspondence of Richardson</i>, Vol. III,
p. 147.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Modesty is the name given here by men to the exactions
of aristocratic pride run mad. Who would risk a lapse of
modesty? Here also, as at Athens, the intellectuals
show a marked tendency to take refuge with courtesans&mdash;that
is to say, with the women whom a scandal shelters
from the need to affect modesty. (<i>Life of Fox.</i>)</p>

<h5>CXVIII</h5>

<p>In the case of love blighted by too prompt a victory, I
have seen in very tender characters crystallisation trying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>to form later. "I don't love you a bit," she says, but

<p>The present-day education of women&mdash;that odd mixture

in the world best calculated to keep off happiness. This
form of education produces minds completely inconsequent.
Madame de R&mdash;&mdash;, who was afraid of dying,
has just met her death through thinking it funny to
throw her medicines out of the window. Poor little
women like her take inconsequence for gaiety, because,
in appearance, gaiety is often inconsequent. 'Tis like
the German, who threw himself out of the window in
order to be sprightly.</p>

<p>Imagination was not stifled: it was only deranged,
and very soon from mere repugnance ceased to picture
the unpleasantness of these dull lovers.</p>

<h5>CXXI</h5>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Metaphysical Reverie</span></p>

<p class="date">Belgirate, <i>26th October</i>, 1816.</p>

<p>Real passion has only to be crossed for it to produce apparently
more unhappiness than happiness. This thought
may not be true in the case of gentle souls, but it is
absolutely proved in the case of the majority of men, and
particularly of cold philosophers, who, as regards passion,
live, one might say, only on curiosity and self-love.</p>

<p>I said all this to the Contessina Fulvia yesterday
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>evening, as we were walking together near the great
pine on the eastern terrace of Isola Bella. She answered:
"Unhappiness makes a much stronger impression on a
man's life than pleasure.</p>

<p>"The prime virtue in anything which claims to give us
pleasure, is that it strikes hard.</p>

<p>"Might we not say that life itself being made up only
of sensation, there is a universal taste in all living beings
for the consciousness that the sensations of their life are
the keenest that can be? In the North people are hardly
alive&mdash;look at the slowness of their movements. The
Italian's <i>dolce far niente</i> is the pleasure of relishing one's
soul and one's emotions, softly reclining on a divan. Such
pleasure is impossible, if you are racing all day on horseback
or in a drosky, like the Englishman or the Russian.
Such people would die of boredom on a divan. There
is no reason to look into their souls.</p>

<p>"Love gives the keenest possible of all sensations&mdash;and
the proof is that in these moments of 'inflammation,'
as physiologists would say, the heart is open to
those 'complex sensations' which Helvétius, Buffon and
other philosophers think so absurd. The other day, as
you know, Luizina fell into the lake; you see, her eye
was following a laurel leaf that had fallen from a tree
on Isola-Madre (one of the Borromean Islands). The
poor woman owned to me that one day her lover, while
talking to her, threw into the lake the leaves of a laurel
branch he was stripping, and said: 'Your cruelty and
the calumnies of your friend are preventing me from
turning my life to account and winning a little glory.'</p>

<p>"It is a peculiar and incomprehensible fact that,
when some great passion has brought upon the soul
moments of torture and extreme unhappiness, the soul
comes to despise the happiness of a peaceful life, where
everything seems framed to our desires. A fine country-house
in a picturesque position, substantial means, a
good wife, three pretty children, and friends charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>and numerous&mdash;this is but a mere outline of all our host.
General C&mdash;&mdash;, possesses. And yet he said, as you know,
he felt tempted to go to Naples and take the command
of a guerilla band. A soul made for passion soon finds
this happy life monotonous, and feels, perhaps, that it
only offers him commonplace ideas. 'I wish,' C. said to
you, 'that I had never known the fever of high passion.
I wish I could rest content with the apparent happiness
on which people pay me every day such stupid compliments,
which, to put the finishing touch to, I have to
answer politely.'"</p>

<p>I, a philosopher, rejoin: "Do you want the thousandth
proof that we are not created by a good Being?
It is the fact that pleasure does not make perhaps half
as much impression on human life as pain...."<a name="FNanchor_1_250" id="FNanchor_1_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_250" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The
Contessina interrupted me. "In life there are few
mental pains that are not rendered sweet by the emotion
they themselves excite, and, if there is a spark of magnanimity
in the soul, this pleasure is increased a hundredfold.
The man condemned to death in 1815 and saved
by chance (M. de Lavalette<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_65" id="TNanch_65"></a><a href="#TN_65">(65)</a></span>, for example), if he was
going courageously to his doom, must recall that moment
ten times a month. But the coward, who was going to
die crying and yelling (the exciseman, Morris, thrown
into the lake, <i>Rob Roy</i>)&mdash;suppose him also saved by
chance&mdash;can at most recall that instant with pleasure
because he was <i>saved</i>, not for the treasures of magnanimity
that he discovered with him, and that take away
for the future all his fears."</p>

<p>I: "Love, even unhappy love, gives a gentle soul, for
whom a thing imagined is a thing existent, treasures of
this kind of enjoyment. He weaves sublime visions of
happiness and beauty about himself and his beloved.
How often has Salviati heard Léonore, with her enchanting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>smile, say, like Mademoiselle Mars in <i>Les Fausses
Confidences</i>: 'Well, yes, I do love you!' No, these
are never the illusions of a prudent mind."</p>

<p>Fulvia (raising her eyes to heaven): "Yes, for you
and me, love, even unhappy love, if only our admiration
for the beloved knows no limit, is the supreme happiness."</p>

<p>(Fulvia is twenty-three,&mdash;the most celebrated beauty of
... Her eyes were heavenly as she talked like this at midnight
and raised them towards the glorious sky above
the Borromean Islands. The stars seemed to answer her.
I looked down and could find no more philosophical
arguments to meet her. She continued:)</p>

<p>"And all that the world calls happiness is not worth
the trouble. Only contempt, I think, can cure this
passion; not contempt too violent, for that is torture.
For you men it is enough to see the object of your
adoration love some gross, prosaic creature, or sacrifice
you in order to enjoy pleasures of luxurious comfort with
a woman friend."</p>

<p>General Teulié told me this evening that he had
found out why, as soon as there were affected women in
a drawing-room, he became so horribly dry and floored
for ideas. It was because he was sure to be bitterly
ashamed of having exposed his feelings with warmth
before such creatures. General Teulié had to speak
from his heart, though the talk were only of Punch and
Judy; otherwise he had nothing to say. Moreover, I
could see he never knew the conventional phrase about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>anything nor what was the right thing to say. That is

<p>Irreligion is bad form at Court, because it is calculated
to be contrary to the interests of princes: irreligion is

<h5>CXXV</h5>

<p>For the soul of a great painter or a great poet, love is
divine in that it increases a hundredfold the empire
and the delight of his art, and the beauties of art are his
soul's daily bread. How many great artists are unconscious
both of their soul and of their genius! Often
they reckon as mediocre their talent for the thing they
adore, because they cannot agree with the eunuchs of the
harem, La Harpe and such-like. For them even unhappy
love is happiness.</p>

<h5>CXXVI</h5>

<p>The picture of first love is taken generally as the most
touching. Why? Because it is the same in all countries
and in all characters. But for this reason first love
is not the most passionate.</p>

<h5>CXXVII</h5>

<p>Reason! Reason! Reason! That is what the world
is always shouting at poor lovers. In 1760, at the most
thrilling moment in the Seven Years' War, Grimm
wrote: "... It is indubitable that the King of Russia,
by yielding Silesia, could have prevented the war from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>ever breaking out. In so doing he would have done a
very wise thing. How many evils would he have prevented!
And what can there be in common between
the possession of a province and the happiness of a king?
Was not the great Elector a very happy and highly
respected prince without possessing Silesia? It is also
quite clear that a king might have taken this course in
obedience to the precepts of the soundest reason, and
yet&mdash;I know not how&mdash;that king would inevitably have
been the object of universal contempt, while Frederick,
sacrificing everything to the <i>necessity</i> of keeping Silesia,
has invested himself with immortal glory.</p>

<p>"Without any doubt the action of Cromwell's son was
the wisest a man could take: he preferred obscurity and
repose to the bother and danger of ruling over a people
sombre, fiery and proud. This wise man won the contempt
of his own time and of posterity; while his father,
to this day, has been held a great man by the wisdom of
nations.</p>

stage, but spoilt by Otway and Colardeau in England and
France. Calista has been dishonoured by a man she
adores; he is odious from the violence of his inborn
pride, but talent, wit and a handsome face&mdash;everything,
in fact&mdash;combine to make him seductive. Indeed,
Lothario would have been too charming could he have
moderated these criminal outbursts. Moreover, an
hereditary and bitter feud separates his family from that
of the woman he loves. These families are at the head
of two factions dividing a Spanish town during the horrors
of the Middle Age. Sciolto, Calista's father, is the chief
of the faction, which at the moment has the upper hand;
he knows that Lothario has had the insolence to try to
seduce his daughter. The weak Calista is weighed down
by the torment of shame and passion. Her father has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>succeeded in getting his enemy appointed to the command
of a naval armament that is setting out on a distant
and perilous expedition, where Lothario will probably
meet his death. In Colardeau's tragedy, he has just
told his daughter this news. At his words Calista can no
longer hide her passion:</p>

</div></div>

<p>"Think of the danger she is placed in. Another word,
and Sciolto will learn the secret of his daughter's passion
for Lothario. The father is confounded and cries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>"At this Calista recovers herself and answers:&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>"By these words Calista stifles her father's rising suspicions;
yet there is no deceit, for the sentiment she
utters is true. The existence of a man, who has succeeded
after winning her love in dishonouring her, must poison
her life, were he even at the ends of the earth. His
death alone could restore her peace of mind, if for unfortunate
lovers peace of mind existed.... Soon after
Lothario is killed and, happily for her, Calista dies.</p>

'Somebody with an enterprising and violent
nature abuses a woman's weakness for him&mdash;that is
nothing to tear our hair over, or at least there is nothing
in Calista's troubles to concern us. She must console
herself with having satisfied her lover, and she will not
be the first woman of merit who has made the best of
her misfortune in that way.'"<a name="FNanchor_5_255" id="FNanchor_5_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_255" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The likelihood of constancy when desire is satisfied
can only be foretold from the constancy displayed, in
spite of cruel doubts and jealousy and ridicule, in the
days before intimate intercourse.</p>

<h5>CXXIX</h5>

<p>A woman is in despair at the death of her lover, who
has been killed in the wars&mdash;of course she means to
follow him. Now first make quite sure that it is not the
best thing for her to do; then, if you decide it is not,
attack her on the side of a very primitive habit of the
human kind&mdash;the desire to survive. If the woman has
an enemy, one may persuade her that her enemy has
obtained a warrant for her imprisonment. Unless that
threat only increases her desire of death, she may think
about hiding herself in order to escape imprisonment.
For three weeks she will lie low, escaping from refuge
to refuge. She must be caught, but must get away after
three days.</p>

<p>Then people must arrange for her to withdraw under
a false name to some very remote town, as unlike as possible
the one in which she was so desperately unhappy.
But who is going to devote himself to the consolation
of a being so unfortunate and so lost to friendship?
(Warsaw, 1808).</p>

<p>Academical wise-heads can see a people's habits in its
language. In Italy, of all the countries in the world, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>word love is least often spoken&mdash;always "amicizia" and
"avvicinar" (<i>amicizia</i> or friendship, for love; <i>avvicinar</i>,

<p>A dictionary of music has never been achieved, nor
even begun. It is only by chance that you find the phrase
for: "I am angry" or "I love you," and the subtler
feelings involved therein. The composer finds them only
when passion, present in his heart or memory, dictates
them to him. Well! that is why people, who spend the
fire of youth studying instead of feeling, cannot be
artists&mdash;the way <i>that</i> works is perfectly simple.</p>

<p>The most flattering thing that the most exalted imagination

among us to take possession of life, of public opinion and

<p>I should like to be able to say something on consolation.
Enough is not done to console.</p>

<p>The main principle is that you try to form a kind of
crystallisation as remote as possible from the source of
present suffering.</p>

<p>In order to discover an unknown principle, we must
bravely face a little anatomy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>If the reader will consult Chapter II of M. Villermé's
work on prisons (Paris, 1820), he will see that the prisoners
"si maritano fra di loro" (it is the expression in the
prisoners' language). The women also "si maritano fra
di loro," and in these unions, generally speaking, much
fidelity is shown. That is an outcome of the principle of
modesty, and is not observed among the men.</p>

<p>"At Saint-Lazare," says M. Villermé, page 96, "a
woman, seeing a new-comer preferred to her, gave herself

<h5>CXXXVI</h5>

<p>I smile when I see earnest people never able to agree, saying
quite unconcernedly the most abusive things of each
other&mdash;and thinking still worse. To live is to feel life&mdash;to
have strong feelings. But strength must be rated for
each individual, and what is painful&mdash;that is, too strong&mdash;for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>one man is exactly enough to stir another's interest.
Take, for example, the feeling of just being spared by the
cannon shot in the line of fire, the feeling of penetrating
into Russia in pursuit of Parthian hordes.... And it is
the same with the tragedies of Shakespeare and those of
Racine, etc., etc.... (Orcha, <i>August</i> 13, 1812.)</p>

<h5>CXXXVII</h5>

<p>Pleasure does not produce half so strong an impression
as pain&mdash;that is the first point. Then, besides this disadvantage
in the quantity of emotion, it is certainly not
half as easy to excite sympathy by the picture of happiness
as by that of misfortune. Hence poets cannot depict
unhappiness too forcibly. They have only one shoal to
fear, namely, things that disgust. Here again, the force
of feeling must be rated differently for monarchies and
republics. A Lewis XIV increases a hundredfold the
number of disgusting things. (Crabbe's Poems.)</p>

<p>By the mere fact of its existence a monarchy <i>à la</i>
Lewis XIV, with its circle of nobles, makes everything
simple in Art become coarse. The noble personage for
whom the thing is exposed feels insulted; the feeling is
sincere&mdash;and in so far worthy.</p>

<p>See what the gentle Racine has been able to make of the
heroic friendship, so sacred to antiquity, of Orestes and
Pylades. Orestes addresses Pylades with the familiar
"thou."[1] Pylades answers him "My Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1_257" id="FNanchor_1_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_257" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> And then
people pretend Racine is our most touching writer! If
they won't give in after this example, we must change
the subject.</p>

<h5>CXXXVIII</h5>

<p>Directly the hope of revenge is possible, the feeling of
hatred returns. Until the last weeks of my imprisonment
it never entered my head to run away and
break the solemn oath I had sworn to my friend. Two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>confidences these&mdash;made this morning in my presence by
a gentleman cut-throat who favoured us with the history
of his life. (Faenza, 1817.)</p>

<p>All Europe, put together, could never make one
French book of the really good type&mdash;the <i>Lettres

<p>I call pleasure every impression which the soul would
rather receive than not receive.<a name="FNanchor_1_258" id="FNanchor_1_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_258" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>I call pain every impression which the soul would
rather not receive than receive.</p>

<p>If I want to go to sleep rather than be conscious of my
feelings, they are undoubtedly pain. Hence the desire
of love is not pain, for the lover will leave the most agreeable
society in order to day-dream in peace.</p>

<p>Time weakens pleasures of the body and aggravates its
pains.</p>

<p>As for spiritual pleasures&mdash;they grow weaker or
stronger according to the passion. For example, after
six months passed in the study of astronomy you like
astronomy all the more, and after a year of avarice money
is still sweeter.</p>

<p>Spiritual pains are softened by time&mdash;how many
widows, really inconsolable, console themselves with
time!&mdash;<i>Vide</i> Lady Waldegrave&mdash;Horace Walpole.</p>

<p>Given a man in a state of indifference&mdash;now let him
have a pleasure;</p>

<p>Given another man in a state of poignant suffering&mdash;suddenly
let the suffering cease;</p>

<p>Now is the pleasure this man feels of the same nature
as that of the other? M. Verri<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_66" id="TNanch_66"></a><a href="#TN_66">(66)</a></span> says Yes, but, to my
mind&mdash;No.</p>

<p>Not all pleasures come from cessation of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>A man had lived for a long time on an income of six
thousand francs&mdash;he wins five hundred thousand in the
lottery. He had got out of the way of having desires
which wealth alone can satisfy.&mdash;And that, by the bye,
is one of my objections to Paris&mdash;it is so easy to lose this
habit there.</p>

<p>The latest invention is a machine for cutting quills.
I bought one this morning and it's a great joy to me,
as I cannot stand cutting them myself. But yesterday
I was certainly not unhappy for not knowing of this
machine. Or was Petrarch unhappy for not taking coffee?</p>

<p>What is the use of defining happiness? Everyone knows
it&mdash;the first partridge you kill on the wing at twelve, the
first battle you come through safely at seventeen....</p>

<p>Pleasure which is only the cessation of pain passes very
quickly, and its memory, after some years, is even distasteful.
One of my friends was wounded in the side by
a bursting shell at the battle of Moscow, and a few days
later mortification threatened. After a delay of some
hours they managed to get together M. Béclar, M. Larrey
and some surgeons of repute, and the result of their consultation
was that my friend was informed that mortification
had not set up. At the moment I could see his
happiness&mdash;it was a great happiness, but not unalloyed.
In the secret depth of his heart he could not believe that
it was really all over, he kept reconsidering the surgeons'
words and debating whether he could rely on them entirely.
He never lost sight completely of the possibility
of mortification. Nowadays, after eight years, if you
speak to him of that consultation, it gives him pain&mdash;it
brings to mind unexpectedly a passed unhappiness.</p>

<p>Pleasure caused by the cessation of pain consists in:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Defeating the continual succession of one's own
misgivings:</p>

<p>2. Reviewing all the advantages one was on the point
of losing.</p>

<p>Pleasure caused by winning five hundred thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>francs consists in foreseeing all the new and unusual
pleasures one is going to indulge in.</p>

<p>There is this peculiar reservation to be made. You
have to take into account whether a man is too used, or
not used enough, to wishing for wealth. If he is not
used enough, if his mind is closely circumscribed, for two
or three days together he will feel embarrassed; while if
he is inclined very often to wish for great riches, he will
find he has used up their enjoyments in advance by too
frequently foretasting them.</p>

<p>This misfortune is unknown to passion-love.</p>

<p>A soul on fire pictures to itself not the last favour, but
the nearest&mdash;perhaps just her hand to press, if, for
example, your mistress is unkind to you. Imagination
does not pass beyond that of its own accord; you may
force it, but a moment later it is gone&mdash;for fear of profaning
its idol.</p>

<p>When pleasure has run through the length of its career,
we fall again, of course, into indifference, but this is not
the same indifference as we felt before. The second
state differs from the first in that we are no longer in a
position to relish with such delight the pleasure that we
have just tasted. The organs we use for plucking pleasures
are worn out. The imagination is no longer so
inclined to offer fancies for the enjoyment of desire&mdash;desire
is satisfied.</p>

<p>In the midst of enjoyment to be torn from pleasure
produces pain.</p>

<p>With regard to physical love and, in fact, physical
pleasure, the disposition of the two sexes is not the same.
Unlike men, practically all women are at least susceptible
in secret to one kind of love. Ever after opening her
first novel at fifteen, a woman is silently waiting for the
coming of passion-love, and towards twenty, when she is
just over the irresponsibility of life's first flush, the suspense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>redoubles. As for men, they think love impossible
or ridiculous, almost before they are thirty.</p>

<h5>CXLII</h5>

<p>From the age of six we grow used to run after pleasure
in our parents' footsteps.</p>

<p>The pride of Contessina Nella's mother was the starting-point

same insane pride she now makes them hopeless. (Venice,

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Romanticism</span></p>

<p>I hear from Paris that there are heaps and heaps
of pictures to be seen there (Exhibition of 1822), representing
subjects taken from the Bible, painted by artists
who hardly believe in it, admired and criticised by people
who don't believe, and finally paid for by people who
don't believe.</p>

<p>After that&mdash;you ask why art is decadent.</p>

<p>The artist who does not believe what he is saying is
always afraid of appearing exaggerated or ridiculous.
How is he to touch the sublime? Nothing uplifts him.
(<i>Lettera di Roma</i>, Giugno, 1822.)</p>

<h5>CXLIV</h5>

<p>One of the greatest poets the world has seen in modern
times is, to my mind, Robert Burns, a Scotch peasant,
who died of want. He had a salary of seventy pounds as
exciseman&mdash;for himself, his wife and four children. One
cannot help saying, by the way, that Napoleon was more
liberal towards his enemy Chénier. Burns had none of
the English prudery about him. His was a Roman genius,
without chivalry and without honour. I have no space
here to tell of his love-affairs with Mary Campbell and their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>mournful ending. I shall merely point out that Edinburgh
is on the same latitude as Moscow&mdash;a fact which
perhaps upsets my system of climates a little.</p>

<p>"One of Burns' remarks, when he first came to Edinburgh,
was that between the men of rustic life and those
of the polite world he observed little difference; that in
the former, though unpolished by fashion and unenlightened
by science, he had found much observation and
much intelligence; but that a refined and accomplished
woman was a being almost new to him, and of which he
had formed but a very inadequate idea." (London,
<i>November 1st</i>, 1821, Vol. V, p. 69.)</p>

<p>The compliments paid to little girls of three furnish
exactly the right sort of education to imbue them with
the most pernicious vanity. To look pretty is the highest
virtue, the greatest advantage on earth. To have a

<p>These idiotic compliments are not current except in
the middle class. Happily they are bad form outside
the suburbs&mdash;being too easy to pay.</p>

<p class="date">Loretto, <i>September 11th</i>, 1811.</p>

<p>I have just seen a very fine battalion composed of
natives of this country&mdash;the remains, in fact, of four
thousand who left for Vienna in 1809. I passed along
the ranks with the Colonel, and asked several of the soldiers
to tell me their story. Theirs is the virtue of the republics
of the Middle Age, though more or less debased by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>Spaniards,<a name="FNanchor_1_259" id="FNanchor_1_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_259" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Roman Church,<a name="FNanchor_2_260" id="FNanchor_2_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_260" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and two centuries of
the cruel, treacherous governments, which, one after
another, have spoiled the country.</p>

<p>Flashing, chivalrous honour, sublime but senseless, is an
exotic plant introduced here only a very few years back.</p>

<p>In 1740 there was no trace of it. <i>Vide</i> de Brosses. The
officers of Montenotte<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_67" id="TNanch_67"></a><a href="#TN_67">(67)</a></span> and of Rivoli<span class="tradanch"><a href="#TN_67">(67)</a></span> had too
many chances of showing their comrades true virtue to
go and <i>imitate</i> a kind of honour unknown to the cottage
homes from which the soldiery of 1796 was drawn&mdash;indeed,
it would have seemed to them highly fantastic.</p>

<p>In 1796 there was no Legion of Honour, no enthusiasm
for one man, but plenty of simple truth and virtue <i>à la</i>
Desaix. We may conclude that honour was imported into
Italy by people too reasonable and too virtuous to cut
much of a figure. One is sensible of a large gap between
the soldiers of '96, often shoeless and coatless, the victors
of twenty battles in one year, and the brilliant regiments
of Fontenoy, taking off their hats and saying to the
English politely: <i>Messieurs, tirez les premiers</i>&mdash;gentlemen,
pray begin.</p>

<p>I am ready to agree that one must judge the soundness
of a system of life by the perfect representative of its
supporters. For example, Richard Cœur-de-Lion is the
perfect pattern on the throne of heroism and chivalrous
valour, and as a king was a ludicrous failure.</p>

<p>Ten years later I met Countess Ottavia again; on
seeing me once more she wept bitterly. I reminded her
of Oginski. "I can no longer love," she told me. I
answered in the poet's words: "How changed, how saddened,
yet how elevated was her character!"</p>

<p>French morals will be formed between 1815 and 1880,
just as English morals were formed between 1668 and
1730. There will be nothing finer, juster or happier than
moral France about the year 1900. At the present day
it does not exist. What is considered infamous in Rue de
Belle-Chasse is an act of heroism in Rue du Mont-Blanc,
and, allowing for all exaggeration, people really worthy of
contempt escape by a change of residence. One remedy we
did have&mdash;the freedom of the Press. In the long run the
Press gives each man his due, and when this due happens
to fall in with public opinion, so it remains. This remedy
is now torn from us&mdash;and it will somewhat retard the
regeneration of morals.</p>

<p>The Abbé Rousseau was a poor young man (1784),
reduced to running all over the town, from morn till
night, giving lessons in history and geography. He fell
in love with one of his pupils, like Abelard with Héloïse or
Saint-Preux with Julie. Less happy than they, no doubt&mdash;yet,
probably, pretty nearly so&mdash;as full of passion as
Saint-Preux, but with a heart more virtuous, more refined
and also more courageous, he seems to have sacrificed
himself to the object of his passion. After dining in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>restaurant at the Palais-Royal with no outward sign of
distress or frenzy, this is what he wrote before blowing
out his brains. The text of his note is taken from the
enquiry held on the spot by the commissary and the
police, and is remarkable enough to be preserved.</p>

<p>"The immeasurable contrast that exists between the
nobility of my feelings and the meanness of my birth, my
love, as violent as it is invincible, for this adorable girl<a name="FNanchor_1_261" id="FNanchor_1_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_261" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
and my fear of causing her dishonour, the necessity of
choosing between crime and death&mdash;everything has made
me decide to say good-bye to life. Born for virtue, I
was about to become a criminal; I preferred death."
(Grimm, Part III, Vol. II, p. 395.)</p>

<p>This is an admirable case of suicide, but would be
merely silly according to the morals of 1880.</p>

<p>The comic presupposes "go" in the public, and <i>brio</i>

Naples by Casaccia, is an impossibility at Paris. There

<p>Since 1530 tyranny <i>à la</i> Philip II has so degraded

thanks to the naturalness which reigns there, nothing
could be simpler. They need only copy faithfully what
stares the world in the face. Think of Cardinal Gonzalvi,
for three hours gravely looking for flaws in the libretto
of an opera-bouffe, and saying uneasily to the composer:
"But you're continually repeating this word <i>Cozzar,

<p>Héloïse speaks of love, a coxcomb of <i>his</i> love&mdash;don't

<p>I quote the following lines from a French letter received
from Znaim, remarking at the same time that
there is not a man in the provinces capable of understanding
my brilliant lady correspondent:&mdash;</p>

<p>"... Chance means a lot in love. When for a whole
year I have read no English, I find the first novel I
pick up delicious. One who is used to the love of a
prosaic being&mdash;slow, shy of all that is refined, and passionately
responsive to none but material interests,
the love of shekels, the glory of a fine stable and
bodily desires, etc.&mdash;can easily feel disgust at the
behaviour of impetuous genius, ardent and uncurbed
in fancy, mindful of love, forgetful of all the rest,
always active and always headlong, just where the
other let himself be led and never acted for himself.
The shock, which genius causes, may offend what, last

féminin</i>&mdash;(is that French?) With the man of genius comes
the startling feeling which with his predecessor was
unknown&mdash;and, remember, this predecessor came to an
untimely end in the wars and remains a synonym for
perfection. This feeling may easily be mistaken for
repulsion by a soul, lofty but without that assurance
which is the fruit of a goodly number of intrigues."</p>

who came from Antioch. And he made for her
many fair songs, with good melodies and suppliant words,
and, for the desire he had to see her, he took the cross
and set out upon the sea to go to her. And it happened
that in the ship a grievous malady took him, in such wise
that those that were with him believed him to be dead,
but they contrived to bring him to Tripoli into a hostelry,
like one dead. They sent word to the countess and she
came to his bed and took him in her arms. Then he
knew that she was the countess and he recovered his sight
and his hearing and he praised God, giving Him thanks
that He had sustained his life until he had seen her.
And thus he died in the arms of the countess, and she
gave him noble burial in the house of the Temple at
Tripoli. And then the same day she took the veil for

that had lived there. Hearing her so much deplored, he
made enquiry after her, and grew so in love with the
description, that no other discourse could at first please
him nor could he at last endure any other; he grew
desperately melancholy and would go to a mount where
the print of her foot was cut and lie there pining and kissing
it all the day long, till at length death in some months'

<p>One of the most important persons of our age, one of
the most prominent men in the Church and in the State,
related to us this evening (January, 1822), at Madame de
M&mdash;&mdash;'s, the very real dangers he had gone through under
the Terror.</p>

<p>"I had the misfortune to be one of the most prominent
members of the Constituent Assembly. I stayed in Paris,
trying to hide myself as best I could, so long as there was
any hope of success there for the good cause. At last, as
the danger grew greater and greater, while the foreigner
made no energetic move in our favour, I decided
to leave&mdash;only I had to leave without a passport.
Everyone was going off to Coblentz, so I determined
to make for Calais. But my portrait had been so
widely circulated eighteen months before, that I was
recognised at the last post. However, I was allowed
to pass and arrived at an inn at Calais, where, you can
imagine, I did not sleep a wink&mdash;and very lucky it was,
since at four o'clock in the morning I heard someone
pronounce my name quite distinctly. While I got up and
was dressing in all haste I could clearly distinguish, in
spite of the darkness, the National Guards with their
rifles; the people had opened the main door for them
and they were entering the courtyard of the inn. Fortunately
it was raining in torrents&mdash;a winter morning,
very dark and with a high wind. The darkness and the
noise of the wind enabled me to escape by the back
courtyard and stables. There I stood in the street
at seven o'clock in the morning, utterly resourceless!
i
I imagined they were following me from my inn.
Hardly knowing what I was doing, I went down to the
port, on to the jetty. I own I had rather lost my head&mdash;everywhere
the vision of the guillotine floated before my
eyes.</p>

<p>A packet-boat was leaving the port in a very rough sea&mdash;it
was already a hundred yards from the jetty. Suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>I heard a shout from out at sea, as if I were being
called. I saw a small boat approaching. "Hi! sir, come
on! We're waiting for you!" Mechanically I got into
the boat. A man was in it. "I saw you walking on the
jetty with a scared look," he whispered, "I thought you
might be some poor fugitive. I've told them you are a
friend I was expecting; pretend to be sea-sick and go
and hide below in a dark corner of the cabin."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fine touch!" cried our hostess. She was
almost speechless and had been moved to tears by the
Abbé's long and excellently told story of his perils.
"How you must have thanked your unknown benefactor!
What was his name?"</p>

<p>"I do not know his name," the Abbé answered, a little
confused.</p>

<p>And there was a moment of profound silence in the
room.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<h3>ON THE COURTS OF LOVE<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_68" id="TNanch_68"></a><a href="#TN_68">(68)</a></span></h3>


<p>There were Courts of Love in France from the year 1150
to the year 1200. So much has been proved. The existence
of these Courts probably goes back to a more remote period.</p>

<p>The ladies, sitting together in the Courts of Love, gave out
their decrees either on questions of law&mdash;for example: Can love
exist between married people?&mdash;</p>

<p>Or on the particular cases which lovers submitted to them.<a name="FNanchor_1_265" id="FNanchor_1_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_265" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>So far as I can picture to myself the moral side of this jurisprudence,
it must have resembled the Courts of the Marshals
of France established for questions of honour by Louis XIV&mdash;that
is, as they would have been, if only public opinion had upheld
that institution.</p>

<p>André, chaplain to the King of France, who wrote about the
year 1170, mentions the Courts of Love</p>

<ul>
<li>of the ladies of Gascony,</li>
<li>of Ermengarde, Viscountess of Narbonne (1144&ndash;1194),</li>
<li>of Queen Eléonore,</li>
<li>of the Countess of Flanders,</li>
<li>of the Countess of Champagne (1174).</li>
</ul>

<p>André mentions nine judgments pronounced by the Countess
of Champagne.</p>

<p>He quotes two judgments pronounced by the Countess of
Flanders.</p>

<p>Jean de Nostradamus, <i>Life of the Provençal Poets</i>, says (p. 15):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The '<i>tensons</i>' were disputes of Love, which took place
between poets, both knights and ladies, arguing together on some
fair and sublime question of love. Where they could not agree,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>they sent them, that they might get a decision thereon, to the
illustrious ladies president who held full and open Court of Love
at Signe and Pierrefeu, or at Romanin, or elsewhere, and they
gave out decrees thereon which were called '<i>Lous Arrests
d'Amours</i>.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>These are the names of some of the ladies who presided over
the Courts of Love of Pierrefeu and Signe:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li>"Stephanette, Lady of Brulx, daughter of the Count of Provence.</li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Adalarie, Viscountess of Avignon;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Alalète, Lady of Ongle;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Hermissende, Lady of Posquières;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bertrane, Lady of Urgon;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Mabille, Lady of Yères;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The Countess of Dye;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Rostangue, Lady of Pierrefeu;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Bertrane, Lady of Signe;</span></li>
<li><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Jausserande of Claustral."&mdash;(Nostradamus, p. 27.)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>It is probable that the same Court of Love met sometimes at
the Castle of Pierrefeu, sometimes at that of Signe. These two
villages are just next to each other, and situated at an almost equal
distance from Toulon and Brignoles.</p>

<p>In his <i>Life of Bertrand d'Alamanon</i>, Nostradamus says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This troubadour was in love with Phanette or Estephanette
of Romanin, Lady of the said place, of the house of Gantelmes,
who held in her time full and open Court of Love in her castle
of Romanin, near the town of Saint-Remy, in Provence, aunt of
Laurette of Avignon, of the house of Sado, so often celebrated
by the poet Petrarch."</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the heading Laurette, we read that Laurette de Sade,
celebrated by Petrarch, lived at Avignon about the year 1341;
that she was instructed by Phanette of Gantelmes, her aunt,
Lady of Romanin; that "both of them improvised in either
kind of Provençal rhythm, and according to the account of the
monk of the Isles d'Or<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_69" id="TNanch_69"></a><a href="#TN_69">(69)</a></span>, their works give ample witness to
their learning.... It is true (says the monk) that Phanette or
Estephanette, as being most excellent in poetry, had a divine
fury or inspiration, which fury was esteemed a true gift from
God. They were accompanied by many illustrious and high-born<a name="FNanchor_2_266" id="FNanchor_2_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_266" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>ladies of Provence, who flourished at that time at Avignon,
when the Roman court resided there, and who gave themselves
up to the study of letters, holding open Court of Love, and therein
deciding the questions of love which had been proposed and sent
to them....</p>

<p>"Guillen and Pierre Balbz and Loys des Lascaris, Counts of
Ventimiglia, of Tende and of Brigue, persons of great renown,
being come at this time to visit Pope Innocent VI of that name,
went to hear the definitions and sentences of love pronounced by
these ladies; and astonished and ravished with their beauty and
learning, they were taken with love of them."</p>

<p>At the end of their "<i>tensons</i>" the troubadours often named
the ladies who were to pronounce on the questions in dispute
between them.</p>

<p>A decree of the Ladies of Gascony runs:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The Court of ladies, assembled in Gascony, have laid down,
with the consent of the whole Court, this perpetual constitution,
etc., etc."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Countess of Champagne in a decree of 1174, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"This judgment, that we have carried with extreme caution,
is supported by the advice of a very great number of ladies..."</p></blockquote>

<p>In another judgment is found:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The knight, for the fraud that has been done him, denounced
this whole affair to the Countess of Champagne, and humbly
begged that this crime might be submitted to the judgment of
the Countess of Champagne and the other ladies."</p>

<p>"The Countess, having summoned around her sixty ladies,
gave this judgment, etc."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>André le Chapelain, from whom we derive this information,
relates that the Code of Love had been published by a Court
composed of a large number of ladies and knights.</p>

<p>André has preserved for us the petition, which was addressed
to the Countess of Champagne, when she decided the following
question in the negative: "Can real love exist between husband
and wife?"</p>

<p>But what was the penalty that was incurred by disobedience
to the decrees of the Courts of Love?</p>

<p>We find the Court of Gascony ordering that such or such of
its judgments should be observed as a perpetual institution, and
that those ladies who did not obey should incur the enmity of
every honourable lady.</p>

<p>Up to what point did public opinion sanction the decrees of
the Courts of Love?</p>

<p>Was there as much disgrace in drawing back from them, as
there would be to-day in an affair dictated by honour?</p>

<p>I can find nothing in André or Nostradamus that puts me in
a position to solve this question.</p>

<p>Two troubadours, Simon Boria and Lanfranc Cigalla, disputed
the question: "Who is worthier of being loved, he who
gives liberally, or he who gives in spite of himself in order to pass
for liberal?"</p>

<p>This question was submitted to the ladies of the Court of
Pierrefeu and Signe; but the two troubadours, being discontented
with the verdict, had recourse to the supreme Court of
Love of the ladies of Romanin.<a name="FNanchor_3_267" id="FNanchor_3_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_267" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The form of the verdicts is conformable to that of the judicial
tribunals of this period.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the reader's opinion as to the degree of
importance which the Courts of Love occupied in the attention
of their contemporaries, I beg him to consider what to-day, in

<li>The allegation of marriage is not a valid plea against love.</li>
<li>Who can dissemble cannot love.</li>
<li>No one can bind himself to two loves at once.</li>
<li>Love grows continually or wanes.</li>
<li>That which a lover takes from another by force has no savour.</li>

<li>A widowhood of two years is prescribed to one lover for the death of the other.</li>
<li>Without over-abundant reason no one ought to be deprived of his rights in love.</li>
<li>No one can love, unless urged thereto by the persuasion of love (by the hope of being loved).</li>
<li>Love will be driven out by avarice.</li>
<li>It is not right to love her whom you would be ashamed to ask in marriage.</li>
<li>True love has no desire for caresses except from the beloved.</li>
<li>Love once divulged is rarely lasting.</li>
<li>Success too easy takes away the charm of love; obstacles give it worth.</li>
<li>Everyone who loves turns pale at the sight of the beloved.</li>
<li>At the unexpected sight of the beloved the lover trembles.</li>
<li>New love banishes old.</li>
<li>Merit alone makes man worthy of love.</li>

<p><i>Question:</i> Can true love exist between married people?</p>

<p><i>Judgment</i> of the Countess of Champagne: We pronounce and
determine by the tenour of these presents, that love cannot
extend its powers over two married persons; for lovers must
grant everything, mutually and gratuitously, the one to the other
without being constrained thereto by any motive of necessity,
while husband and wife are bound by duty to agree the one
with the other and deny each other in nothing.... Let this
judgment, which we have passed with extreme caution and with
the advice of a great number of other ladies, be held by you as
the truth, unquestionable and unalterable.</p>

<h3>NOTE ON ANDRÉ LE CHAPELAIN<span class="tradanch"><a name="TNanch_70" id="TNanch_70"></a><a href="#TN_70">(70)</a></span></h3>


<p><span class="smcap">André Le Chapelain</span> appears to have written about the year
1176.</p>

<p>In the Bibliothèque du Roi may be found a manuscript (No.
8758) of the work of André, which was formerly in the possession
of Baluze. Its first title is as follows: "Hic incipiunt capitula
libri de Arte amatoria et reprobatione amoris."</p>

<p>This title is followed by the table of chapters.</p>

<p>Then we have the second title:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Incipit liber de Arte amandi et de reprobatione amoris
editus et compillatus a magistro Andrea, Francorum aulae regiæ
capellano, ad Galterium amicum suum, cupientem in amoris
exercitu militari: in quo quidem libro, cujusque gradus et
ordinis mulier ab homine cujusque conditionis et status ad amorem
sapientissime invitatur; et ultimo in fine ipsius libri de amoris
reprobatione subjungitur."</p>

<p>Crescimbeni, <i>Lives of the Provençal Poets</i>, sub voce Percivalle
Boria, cites a manuscript in the library of Nicolo Bargiacchi, at
Florence, and quotes various passages from it. This manuscript
is a translation of the treatise of André le Chapelain. The
Accademia della Crusca admitted it among the works which
furnished examples for its dictionary.</p>

<p>There have been various editions of the original Latin. Frid.
Otto Menckenius, in his <i>Miscellanea Lipsiensia nova, Leipsic</i> 1751,
Vol. VIII, part I, pp. 545 and ff., mentions a very old edition
without date or place of printing, which he considers must belong
to the first age of printing: "Tractatus amoris et de amoris
remedio Andreae cappellani Innocentii papae quarti."</p>

<p>A second edition of 1610 bears the following title:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Erotica seu amatoria</i> Andreae capellani regii, vetustissimi
scriptoris ad venerandum suum amicum Guualterium scripta,
nunquam ante hac edita, sed saepius a multis desiderata; nunc
tandem fide diversorum MSS. codicum in publicum emissa a
Dethmaro Mulhero, Dorpmundae, typis Westhovianis, anno Una
Caste et Vere amanda."</p>

<p>A third edition reads: "Tremoniae, typis Westhovianis, anno
1614.".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>André divides thus methodically the subjects which he proposes
to discuss:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>Quid sit amor et unde dicatur.<a name="FNanchor_1_270" id="FNanchor_1_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_270" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></li>
<li>Quis sit effectus amoris.</li>
<li>Inter quos possit esse amor.</li>
<li>Qualiter amor acquiratur, retineatur, augmentetur, minuatur,
finiatur.</li>
<li>De notitia mutui amoris, et quid unus amantium agere
debeat, altero fidem fallente.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each of these questions is discussed in several paragraphs.</p>

<p>Andreas makes the lover and his lady speak alternately. The
lady raises objections, the lover tries to convince her with reasons
more or less subtle. Here is a passage which the author puts into
the mouth of the lover:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... Sed si forte horum sermonum te perturbet obscuritas,"
eorum tibi sententiam indicabo<a name="FNanchor_2_271" id="FNanchor_2_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_271" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Ab antiquo igitur quatuor sunt in amore gradus distincti:</p>

<p><i>Primus</i>, in spei datione consistit.</p>

<p><i>Secundus</i>, in osculi exhibitione.</p>

<p><i>Tertius</i>, in amplexus fruitione.</p>

<p><i>Quartus</i>, in totius concessione personae finitur."</p></blockquote>

<ol>
<li>What love is and whence it is so-called.</li>
<li>What are the effects of love?</li>
<li>Between whom love can exist.</li>
<li>In what way love is won, kept, made to increase, to wane or to end.</li>
<li>The way to know if love is returned, and what one of the lovers

I shall give you the argument:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
From all antiquity there are four different degrees of love:
</p>
<p>
The first consists in giving hope.
</p>
<p>
The second in the offer of a kiss.
</p>
<p>
The third in the enjoyment of the most intimate caresses.
</p>
<p>
The fourth in the surrender of body and soul.</p></div>

<h3>TRANSLATORS' NOTES</h3>


<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_1" id="TN_1"></a><a href="#TNanch_1">1.</a></span> The Portuguese Nun, Marianna Alcaforado, was born of
a distinguished Portuguese family in the second half of
the seventeenth century. About 1662, while still a nun, she fell
in love with a French officer, the Chevalier de Chamilly, to whom
she addressed her famous letters. The worthiness of the object
of her passion may be judged by the fact that, on his return to
Paris, the Chevalier handed over these letters to Sublingy, a
lawyer, to be translated and published. They appeared in 1669,
published by Barbin, under the title <i>Lettres Portuguaises</i>, and have
since been often reprinted. Marianna Alcaforado died at the
end of the seventeenth or the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>There are only five original letters, though many editions
contain the seven spurious letters, attributed to a "femme du
monde"&mdash;they are already in Barbin's second edition.</p>

<p>There is an admirable seventeenth-century English translation
of her letters by Sir Roger L'Estrange.</p>

<p>The passion of Héloïse for Abelard hardly calls for commentary.
There is no clue to the identity of Captain de Vésel and Sergeant
de Cento. A note in Calmann-Lévy's edition tells us that, in
reply to enquiries about these two mysterious people, Stendhal
said that he had forgotten their stories.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_2" id="TN_2"></a><a href="#TNanch_2">2.</a></span> <i>Justine ou les Malheurs de la Vertu</i>, by the famous Marquis
de Sade, was published in Holland, 1791.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_3" id="TN_3"></a><a href="#TNanch_3">3.</a></span> Cf. Coleridge, <i>Love's Apparition and Evanishment</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_4" id="TN_4"></a><a href="#TNanch_4">4.</a></span> Cf. Chapter VIII, p. <a href="#Page_35">35</a> below. The ideas contained in
these two passages are the germ of a story written by Stendhal
with the obvious intention of illustrating his theories. The story&mdash;"Ernestine"&mdash;is
included in the Calmann-Lévy edition of
<i>De l'Amour</i>.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_5" id="TN_5"></a><a href="#TNanch_5">5.</a></span> Cf. a letter of Sir John Suckling "<i>to a Friend to dissuade him
from marrying a widow, which he formerly had been in love with</i>":&mdash;</p>

<p>"Love is a natural distemper, a kind of Small Pox: Every one
either hath had it or is to expect it, and the sooner the better."</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_6" id="TN_6"></a><a href="#TNanch_6">6.</a></span> Léonore: under this name Stendhal refers to Métilde
Dembowski (<i>née</i> Viscontini). His passion for the wife of General
Dembowski, with whom he became intimate during his stay in
Milan (1814&ndash;1821), forms one of the most important chapters in
Stendhal's life, but it is a little disappointing to enquire too
deeply into the object of this passion. At any rate, as far as one
can see, the great qualities which Stendhal discovered in Métilde
Dembowski had their existence rather in his expert crystallisation
than in reality. It was an unhappy affair. Métilde's cousin used
her influence to injure Stendhal, and in 1819 she cut off all communication
with him. Stendhal was still bemoaning his fate on
his arrival in England, 1821. There is, none the less, something
unconvincing in certain points in the history of this attachment; in
spite of his sorrow, Stendhal seems to have consoled himself in the
Westminster Road with "little Miss Appleby." It is worth noticing
that Métilde Dembowski had been the confidante of Signora
Pietra Grua, his former mistress, and it was from the date of
Stendhal's discovery of the latter's shameless infidelity to himself
and other lovers, that his admiration for Métilde seems to have
started.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_7" id="TN_7"></a><a href="#TNanch_7">7.</a></span> It is here worth turning to a passage from Baudelaire&mdash;which
is given in the Translators' note <a href="#TN_11">(11)</a> below. Liberty in
love, he says, consists in avoiding the kind of woman dangerous to
oneself. He points out that a natural instinct prompts one to
this spontaneous self-preservation. Stendhal here gives a more
exact explanation of the operation of this instinctive selection in
love. Schopenhauer's conception of the utilitarian nature of
bodily beauty is a more general application of the same idea. The
breasts of a woman <i>à la</i> Titian are a pledge of fitness for maternity&mdash;therefore
they are beautiful. Stendhal would have said a
pledge of fitness for giving pleasure.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_8" id="TN_8"></a><a href="#TNanch_8">8.</a></span> The well-known Dr. Edwards, in whose house Stendhal
was introduced to one side of English life&mdash;and a very bourgeois
side. He was introduced by a brother of Dr. Edwards, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>man given to the peculiarly gloomy kind of debauch of which
Stendhal gives such an exaggerated picture in his account of
England. See note <a href="#TN_31">31</a> below.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_9" id="TN_9"></a><a href="#TNanch_9">9.</a></span> This brings to mind Blake's view of imagination and "the
rotten rags" of memory.</p>

in <i>Le Corsaire Satan</i> (March 3, 1846) and reprinted in <i>Œuvres
Posthumes</i>, Paris, 1908.</p>

<p>"Sans nier les coups de foudre, ce qui est impossible&mdash;voyez
Stendhal...&mdash;il faut que la fatalité jouit d'une certaine
élasticité qui s'appelle liberté humaine.... En amour la
liberté consiste à éviter les catégories de femmes dangereuses,
c'est-à-dire dangereuses pour vous."</p>

<p>["Without denying the possibility of 'thunderbolts,' for that
is impossible (see Stendhal)&mdash;one may yet believe that fatality
enjoys a certain elasticity, called human liberty.... In love
human liberty consists in avoiding the categories of dangerous
women&mdash;that is, women dangerous for you."]</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_12" id="TN_12"></a><a href="#TNanch_12">12.</a></span> Paul Louis Courier (1772&ndash;1825) served with distinction
as an officer in Napoleon's army. He resigned his commission in
1809, in order to devote himself to literature, and especially to
the study of Greek. His translation of <i>Daphnis and Chloe</i>, from
the Greek of Longus, is well known, and was the cause of
his long controversy with Del Furia, the under-librarian of
the Laurentian Library at Florence, to which Stendhal here
refers. Courier had discovered a complete manuscript of this
romance in the famous Florentine Library. By mistake, he soiled
with a blot of ink the page of the manuscript containing the all-important
passage, which was wanting in all previously known
manuscripts. Del Furia, jealous of Courier's discovery, accused
him of having blotted the passage on purpose, in order to
monopolise the discovery. A lively controversy followed, in which
the authorities entered. Courier was guilty of nothing worse than
carelessness, and, needless to say, got the better of his adversaries,
when it came to a trial with the pen.</p>

during his imprisonment at Vincennes (1777&ndash;1780). They
were addressed to Sophie de Monnier; it was his relations with
her which had brought him into prison. They were published in

married the Duc de Montpensier. She was lame, but she had
other reasons besides his scoffing at her infirmity for her undying
hatred of Henry III; for she could lay at his door the death of
her brother Henry, the third Duke. She died in 1596.</p>

liberal in the period of reaction which followed the fall of Napoleon
and the end of the revolutionary period. Stendhal had been one
of Napoleon's officers, and the Bourbon restoration put an end
to his career. His liberalism and his pride at having been one of
those who followed Napoleon's glorious campaigns, colour everything
he writes about the state of Europe in his time. In reading
Stendhal's criticisms of France, England and Italy, we must put
ourselves back in 1822&mdash;remember that in France we have the
Royalist restoration, in England the cry for reform always growing
greater and beginning to penetrate even into the reactionary
government of Lord Liverpool (Peel, Canning, Huskisson), in
Italy the rule of the "Pacha" (see below, note <a href="#TN_29">29</a>) and the beginning
of Carbonarism (of which Stendhal was himself suspected,
see below, note <a href="#TN_27">27</a>), and the long struggle for unity and independence.</p>

Italy was not only his favourite, but also the one he knew and
understood best. He was pleased in later years to discover
Italian blood in his own family on the maternal side. The Gagnon
family, from which his mother came, had, according to him,
crossed into France about 1650.</p>

<p>He was in Italy with little interruption from 1814&ndash;1821, and
again from 1830&ndash;1841 as consul at Civita Vecchia, during which
time he became intimately acquainted with the best, indeed every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>kind of Italian society. He tells us that fear of being implicated
in the <i>Carbonari</i> troubles drove him from Italy in 1821.</p>

<p>One can well believe that a plain speaker and daring thinker
like Stendhal would have been looked upon by the Austrian police
with considerable suspicion.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_28" id="TN_28"></a><a href="#TNanch_28">28.</a></span> Racine and Shakespeare. Very early in life Stendhal
refused to accept the conventional literary valuations. Racine
he put below Corneille&mdash;Racine, like Voltaire, he says, fills his
works with "bavardage éternel." Shakespeare became for Stendhal
the master dramatist, and he is never tired of the comparison
between him and Racine. Cf. <i>Rome, Naples et Florence</i> (1817),
and <i>Histoire de la Peinture en Italie</i> (1817). Finally he published
his work on the subject: <i>Racine et Shakespeare par M. de Stendhal</i>
(1823).</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_29" id="TN_29"></a><a href="#TNanch_29">29.</a></span> Stendhal knew Italy and was writing in Italy in the dark
period that followed the fall of Napoleon. The "Pacha" is,
of course, the repressive and reactionary government, whether
that of the Austrians in Lombardy, of the Pope in Rome, or of
the petty princes in the minor Italian states. See above, note <a href="#TN_27">27</a>.</p>

Almaviva stands for the aristocracy and cuts a sad figure beside

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Stendhal's Acquaintance with England</span></p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_31" id="TN_31"></a><a href="#TNanch_31">31.</a></span> Baretti, Dr. Johnson's friend, has the reputation of having
learnt English better than any other foreigner. Stendhal might
well claim a similar distinction for having acquired in a short stay
a grasp so singularly comprehensive of England&mdash;of English
people and their ways. He was four times in England&mdash;in 1817,
1821, 1826, and 1838&mdash;never for a whole year in succession, and
on the first occasion merely on a flying trip. But Stendhal had
not only a great power of observing and assimilating ideas; he was
also capable of accommodating himself to association with the most
varied types. Stendhal was as appreciative of Miss Appleby&mdash;his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>little mistress in the Westminster Road&mdash;as of Lord Byron
and Shelley: he was at home in the family circle of the Edwards
and the Clarkes. From the first he was sensible of the immense
value of his friendship with the lawyer, Sutton Sharpe (1797&ndash;1843).
Sharpe was one of those Englishmen who seem made
for the admiration of foreigners&mdash;possessing all the Englishman's
sense and unaffected dignity and none of his morbid reserve or
insularity. Porson, Opie, Flaxman, Stothard were familiar
figures in the house of Sharpe's father, and Sharpe and his charming
sister continued to be the centre of a large and intelligent
circle. In 1826 Sharpe took Stendhal with him on circuit.
Stendhal was often present in court and learnt from his
friend, who in 1841 became Q. C., to admire the real character,
so rarely appreciated abroad, of English justice. He took this
opportunity of visiting also Manchester, York, and the Lake
district. Likewise to Sharpe he owed the privilege of meeting
Hook, the famous wit and famous bibber, at the Athenaeum.
He was present even at one of Almack's balls&mdash;the most select
entertainment of that time.</p>

<p>With an acquaintance with England at once so varied, so full
and yet so short, as regards direct intercourse with the country
and people, it is rather natural that Stendhal was wary of subscribing
to any one very settled conception of the English. He
felt the incongruity of their character. At one time he called
them "la nation la plus civilisée et la plus puissante du monde
entier"&mdash;the most civilised and powerful people on the face of
the earth; at another they were only "les premiers hommes
pour le steam-engine"; and then, he merely felt a sorrowful
affection for them&mdash;as for a people who just missed getting the
profit of their good qualities by shutting their eyes to their bad.</p>

<p>As for Stendhal's knowledge of English literature&mdash;of that
the foundations were laid early in life. His enthusiasm for
Shakespeare was a very early passion (cf. Translators' note <a href="#TN_28">28</a>).
As years went on, his acquaintance with English thought and
English literature became steadily wider. Significant is his
familiarity with Bentham, whose views were congenial to
Stendhal: Stendhal quotes him more than once. Hobbes
he was ready to class with Condillac, Helvétius, Cabanis and
Destutt de Tracy, as one of the philosophers most congenial and
useful to his mind. For the rest, the notes and quotations in
this book leave no doubt of the extent of his English reading&mdash;they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>give one a poorer opinion of his purely linguistic capacities;
Stendhal's own English is often most comical. For a very complete
consideration of his connexion with England see <i>Stendhal
et l'Angleterre</i>, by Doris Gunnell (Paris, 1909). Cf. also Chuquet's
<i>Stendhal-Beyle</i> (Paris, 1902), Chap. IX, pp. 178 and ff.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_32" id="TN_32"></a><a href="#TNanch_32">32.</a></span> Of the three Englishmen referred to here, James Beattie
(1735&mdash;1803), the author of <i>The Minstrel</i> (published 1771&ndash;1774),
and Richard Watson (1737&ndash;1816), Bishop of Llandaff (1782), a
distinguished chemist and a man of liberal political views, will
both be familiar to readers of Boswell. The third, John Chetwode
Eustace (1762?-1815) was a friend of Burke and a Roman
Catholic, who seems to have given some trouble to the Catholic
authorities in England and Ireland. His <i>Tour through Italy</i>, to
which Stendhal refers, was published in 1813.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_34" id="TN_34"></a><a href="#TNanch_34">34.</a></span> The Whiteboys were a secret society, which originated in
Ireland about 1760 and continued spasmodically till the end of
the century. In 1821 it reappeared and gave great trouble to
the authorities; in 1823 the society adopted another name.
The yeomanry was embodied in Ulster in September 1796, and was
mainly composed of Orangemen and Protestants. The body was
instrumental in disarming Ulster and in suppressing the rebellion of
1798&mdash;not, it has been maintained, without unnecessary cruelty.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_35" id="TN_35"></a><a href="#TNanch_35">35.</a></span> Sir Benjamin Bloomfield (1786&ndash;1846), a distinguished
soldier, ultimately did get his peerage in 1825. In 1822 he had
resigned his office of receiver of the duchy of Cornwall, having
lost the King's confidence after many years of favour.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_36" id="TN_36"></a><a href="#TNanch_36">36.</a></span> Stendhal's personal knowledge of Spain was less extensive
than that of Italy, England and Germany. He was early interested
in the country and its literature. In 1808 at Richemont he
was reading a <i>Histoire de la guerre de la succession d'Espagne</i>,
and the same year speaks of his plan of going to Spain to study the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>language of Cervantes and Calderon. In 1810 he actually took
Spanish lessons and the next year applied from Germany for an
official appointment in Spain. In 1837 he made his way as far as
Barcelona.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Stendhal's Acquaintance with Germany</span></p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_37" id="TN_37"></a><a href="#TNanch_37">37.</a></span> In 1806 Stendhal returned to Paris from Marseilles whither
he had followed the actress Melanie Guilbert and taken up a
commercial employment in order to support himself at her side.
He now again put himself under the protection of Daru, and
followed him into Germany, though at first without any fixed
title. He was not at Jena, as he pretends (being still in Paris the
7th October), but on the 27th of the month he witnessed Napoleon's
triumphal entry into Berlin. Two days later he was nominated
by Daru to the post of assistant <i>commissaire des guerres</i>.</p>

<p>Stendhal arrived in Brunswick in 1806 to take up his
official duties. Although his time was occupied with a considerable
amount of business, he found leisure also for visiting
the country at ease. In 1807 he went as far as
Hamburg. His observations on the country and people are
occurring continually in his works, particularly in his letters and
in his <i>Voyage à Brunswick</i> (in <i>Napoléon</i>, ed. de Mitty, Paris,
1897), pp. 92&ndash;125. In 1808 he left Brunswick, but soon returned
with Daru to Germany. This time he was employed at Strasbourg&mdash;whence
he passed to Ingolstadt, Landshut, etc., etc. Facts prove
that he was not at the battle of Wagram, as he says in his <i>Life of
Napoleon</i>. He was at the time at Vienna, where he managed to
remain for the <i>Te Deum</i> sung in honour of the Emperor Francis
II after the evacuation by the French. He returned in 1810,
after the peace of Schonnbrunn, to Paris. It was during his stay
in Brunswick that Stendhal made the acquaintance of Baron von
Strombeck, for whom he always preserved a warm affection.
He was a frequent guest at the house of von Strombeck and a
great admirer of his sister-in-law, Phillippine von Bülow&mdash;who
died Abbess of Steterburg&mdash;<i>la celeste Phillippine</i>. Baron von
Strombeck is referred to in this work as M. de Mermann. See
generally Chuquet, <i>Stendhal-Beyle</i>, Chap. V.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_39" id="TN_39"></a><a href="#TNanch_39">39.</a></span> The Provencal story in this chapter, and the Arabic
anecdotes in the next, were translated for Stendhal by his friend
Claude Fauriel (1772&ndash;1806)&mdash;"the only savant in Paris who is
not a pedant," he calls him in a letter written in 1829 (<i>Correspondance
de Stendhal</i>, Paris, Charles Brosse, 1908, Vol. II, p.
516). A letter of 1822 (Vol. II, p. 247) thanks M. Fauriel for his
translations. "If I were not so old," he writes, "I should learn
Arabic, so charmed am I to find something at last that is not a
mere academic copy of the antique.... My little ideological
treatise on Love will now have some variety. The reader will be
carried beyond the circle of European ideas." Saint-Beuve relates
that he was present when Fauriel showed Stendhal, then engaged
on his <i>De l'Amour</i>, an Arab story which he had translated. Stendhal
seized on it, and Fauriel was only able to recover his story by
promising two more like it in exchange. M. Fauriel is referred to

great extent their language too, is taken straight from an article
in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>&mdash;January 1810&mdash;by Thomas Broadbent.
See for a full comparison of the English and French, Doris
Gunnell&mdash;<i>Stendhal et l'Angleterre</i>, Appendix B.</p>

<p>Stendhal has not only adapted the ideas&mdash;he has to a great
extent translated the words of Thomas Broadbent. He has
changed the order of ideas here and there&mdash;not the ideas themselves&mdash;and
in some cases he has enlarged their application. Where
he has translated the English word for word, it has often been
possible in this translation to restore the original English, which
Stendhal borrowed and turned into French. Where we have
done this, we have printed the words, which belong to Thomas
Broadbent, in italics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>However, as Stendhal often introduced slight, but important,
changes of language, we also give below, as an example of his
methods, longer passages chosen from the article in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, to compare with the corresponding passages literally
translated by us from Stendhal.</p>

<p>These are the passages:&mdash;</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_225">225</a>, l. 2:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As if women were more quick and men more judicious, as if
women were more remarkable for delicacy of expression and men
for stronger powers of attention."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_228">228</a>, l. 9:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Knowledge, where it produces any bad effects at all, does as
much mischief to one sex as to the other.... Vanity and conceit
we shall of course witness in men and women, as long as the
world endures.... The best way to make it more tolerable is
to give it as high and dignified an object as possible."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_229">229</a>, l. 21:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Women have, of course, all ignorant men for enemies to their
instruction, who being bound (as they think) in point of sex to
know more, are not well pleased in point of fact to know less."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_230">230</a>, l. 24:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The same desire of pleasing, etc.... We are quite astonished
in hearing men converse on such subjects to find them
attributing such beautiful effects to ignorance."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_232">232</a>, l. 31:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We do not wish a lady to write books any more than we wish
her to dance at the opera."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>, l. 13:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A merely accomplished woman cannot infuse her tastes into
the minds of her sons....</p>

<p>"By having gained information a mother may inspire her sons
with valuable tastes, which may abide by them through life and
carry him up to all the sublimities of knowledge."</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_237">237</a>, l. 27:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mankind are much happier for the discovery of barometers,
thermometers, steam-engines and all the innumerable inventions
in the arts and the sciences.... The same observation is true
of such works as those of Dryden, Pope, Milton and Shakespeare."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>Stendhal's habit of quoting without acknowledgment from
all kinds of writings is so curious, that it demands a word to itself.
His wholesale method of plagiarism has been established in other
works beside the present one; almost the whole of his first work&mdash;<i>La
Vie de Haydn</i> (1814)&mdash;is stolen property. See above,
note <a href="#TN_18">18</a>. Goethe was amused to find his own experiences
transferred to the credit of the author of <i>Rome, Naples et
Florence!</i></p>

<p>If there is any commentary necessary on this literary piracy&mdash;it
is to be found in a note by Stendhal (<i>vide</i> above, Chapter
XXXVII, p. <a href="#Page_132">132</a>) on a passage where, for once, he actually
acknowledges a thought from La Rochefoucauld:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The reader will have recognised, without my marking it
each time, several other thoughts of celebrated writers. It is
history which I am attempting to write, and such thoughts are
the facts."</p></blockquote>

into France soon after the Bourbon Restoration; but it
was not, like our monitorial system, designed with a view primarily
to the maintenance of discipline, but rather to supplying the want
of schools and masters and remedying the official indifference to
popular education, which then existed in France. As such, it was
warmly espoused by the liberals, and as warmly opposed by the
reactionaries. The monitors, it was thought, could hand on to
the younger pupils the knowledge they had already received;
after the Revolution of 1830, when no longer the object of political
controversy, the system gave way to more practical and efficient
methods of public instruction.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_45" id="TN_45"></a><a href="#TNanch_45">45.</a></span> Porlier (Don Juan Diaz), born in 1783, was publicly hanged
in 1815 as the result of a conspiracy against Ferdinand VII of
Spain. After having been one of the most active and bravest
supporters of Ferdinand's cause in the effort to re-establish his
throne and the national honour, he now sacrificed his life
to an unsuccessful attempt to set up a constitutional government.</p>

<p>Antonio Quiroga (born 1784), also after having distinguished
himself in the national struggle against Napoleon, was tried for
complicity in the conspiracy, after the fall of Porlier. After a
series of adventures, in which he was more lucky than Riego, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>subaltern, to whom he owed so much, he again distinguished
himself, after a temporary withdrawal from active service in
1822, by the stout opposition he offered to the French invasion
of 1823. His efforts, however, were of no avail and he escaped
to England, and thence made his way to South America. Some
years later he returned to Spain, was nominated Captain General
of Grenada, and died in 1841.</p>

<p>Rafael del Riego (born 1785), after serving against the French,
first became prominent in connexion with the effort to
restore the constitution which Ferdinand had abolished in 1812.
He was elected by his troops second in command to Quiroga,
whom he himself proposed as their leader. This rising was a
failure and Riego was exiled to Oviedo, his birthplace. After
being repeatedly recalled and re-exiled, he ended by being one
of the first victims of Ferdinand's restoration in 1823, and was
dragged to the place of execution at the back of a donkey, amid
the outrages of the mob.</p>

our only philosopher. It is on Tracy, one of the
Ideologists, that Stendhal, one might say, modelled his philosophic
attitude. Tracy's <i>Idéologie</i> (1801), he says, gave him
"milles germes de pensées nouvelles"&mdash;gave him also his worship
of logic. He was equally impressed by the <i>Traité de la Volonté</i>
(1815). Cf. Picavet's Sorbonne Thesis (Paris, 1891) <i>Les Idéologues</i>,
pp. 489&ndash;92, in which he speaks of Stendhal as "a successor
and a defender, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of the eighteenth-century

fearless and sincere of the Revolutionary leaders, was the constitutional
Bishop of Blois, who refused to lay down his episcopal
office under the Terror, and when the Reign of Terror was over,
took an active part in restoring Religion and the Church. He
resigned his bishopric in 1801. Napoleon made him a count
but he was always hostile to the Empire. He was a staunch
Gallican, and never forgave Napoleon his concordat with the
Papacy. He was naturally hated and feared by the Royalists at
the Restoration, but he remained popular with the people, and
was elected a member of the lower chamber in 1819, though he
was prevented by the Government from sitting.</p>

of the same name, was a man of immense wealth and the
foremost French financier of his day. He was born a Protestant,
not, as has been thought, a Jew, but became a Catholic after the
Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685). He was ennobled and
became the Comte de Coubert (1725).</p>

remarked on Stendhal's absurdly exaggerated praise of
Helvétius. After quoting this passage, he adds: "My friend
Mr. Beyle here lays too much stress on a borrowed verbal fallacy."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>Hobbes and Mandeville, he says, had long before stated, and
Butler answered, this fallacy, which not unfrequently vitiates
Stendhal's psychological views.</p>

<p class="tradnote"><span class="tradnum"><a name="TN_61" id="TN_61"></a><a href="#TNanch_61">61.</a></span> Jean Francois de la Harpe (born 1739) is frequently mentioned
by Stendhal in this hostile spirit. After winning considerable
notoriety, without very much merit, La Harpe in 1786
became professor of literature at the newly founded Lycée.
Having started as a Voltairian philosopher, and still apparently
favourable to the Revolution, he was none the less arrested in
1794 as a suspect and put into prison. There he was converted
from his former Voltairian principles to Roman Catholicism.
He died in 1803.</p>

songs, which had made Béranger's name, brought him in 1828,
for the second time, into prison. He refused office after the revolution
(1830), for the principles of which he had already suffered;

he was condemned to death, but escaped, chiefly owing to his

against their historical existence the English reader may be
referred to Chaytor, <i>The Troubadours</i> (in the <i>Cambridge Manuals
of Science and Literature</i>, 1912), pp. 19&ndash;21. But while the direct
evidence for their existence is very flimsy, the direct evidence

point. Stendhal gives its date as 1176; Reynouard and others,
1170. Others again have placed it as late as the fourteenth
century, though this has been proved impossible, since thirteenth-century
writers refer to the book. The probability is that it was
written at the beginning of the thirteenth or end of the twelfth
century&mdash;there is no evidence to fix the date with precision.

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
